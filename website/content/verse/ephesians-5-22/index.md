As the 1870s began, the topic of women's rights, and specifically of a woman's right to vote, was a matter of common public discussion. The fifteenth amendment, ratified in 1870, gave black men the right to vote but it ignored the question of women's suffrage The founding of the National Women's Suffrage Association and the American Woman Suffrage Association institutionalized the pursuit of women's suffrage. The question of women's suffrage among activists for political reform was no longer one that could be ignored, as it had been shunted aside in the pursuit of emancipation and black male suffrage.

Yet it was by no means the situation that the case for women's suffrage, or more broadly an adjustment of women's role in familial and cultural settings, was felt to be necessary or obvious. Both American Protestantism and American society more generally had long discussed the roles of women. By the early republic, the assumption was that women's roles ought primarily to be domestic. American Christianity, especially the endless array of benevolence and auxiliary movements to the church, did give women a source of authority and action in public, though even there the authority was often assumed to come from women's domestic role.^[Cite Zagarri, Revolutionary Backlash; Brekus on female preachers.] 

A robust, fleshed out discussion of women's roles was a common feature of sermons, newspapers, and the like from the early republic on. The key text that was often used was Ephesians 5:22, "Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands." While other texts like Colossians 3:18 or TODO were also prominent, this text was especially important because it was used to ground women's identity in terms of the marriage relationship and in terms of submission. That text enjoyed a longtime and longspread usage as a tool for explaining women's role, which would then come to be challenged by women's suffrage and first-wave feminism, only to be reasserted with all the more vigor.

BEAT 1: How the verse was used to establish women's role

Whenever the role of women in society was discussed from a Christian perspective, Ephesians 5:22 was usually chief among the key texts that were used. In sermons, but also in essays and editorials published in newspapers, the meaning people ascribed to the verse was explained. The lines of the interpretative consensus were fairly clear. One of the chief ideas about "the New Testament woman" was that the home was the "sphere of her activities and ministries" and that the woman should "spontaneously and joyfully recognizes the husband as head of the household." In contrast to the joyfulness with which women were to accept their role, there was an implication that some women did not: "The New Testament woman is not of those who call the proper headship of the husband, tyranny, and the corresponding subjections of the wife, slavery, and seek emancipation and elevation in a persistent loud-mouthed cry for equality."^[*Lamoille Newsdealer* (Hyde Park, VT), [01 Feb. 1870](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84023428/1870-02-01/ed-1/seq-1/#words=wives+submit+unto+husbands+unto+lord).] 

These sermons and essays had to acknowledge that submission was not likely to come be easy, even if it was supposed to be joyful. Why should women be expected to submit to their husbands? The common answer was that submission was not in fact natural for women, just as love was not natural for men. Men, who had "stern, strong natures" and a "high sense of manliness" had to learn how to love. A woman, on the other hand "needs no special encouragement to love," because that was here nature. But by nature she was inclined to rebellion, and so she need encouragement to "subordination" and "submission."^[The Gold Leaf (Henderson, NC), [29 Aug. 1895](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn91068402/1895-08-29/ed-1/seq-1/#words=wives+submit+unto+husbands+unto+lord).] The answer, in other words, was that both men and women had fixed natures, and that Ephesians 5 was targeted at the failings in each. 

Women's fixed nature, which desired to master her husband rather than submit to him, was sometimes explicitly connected to the fall, and the curse God put on Eve in Genesis 3:16 (TODO create link) ("I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.") That verse was often interpreted to mean that women's desire would be to rule over their husband, rather than by ruled by him. The key, as told in a serialized Christian fiction called *Her Lot; or, How She Was Protected*, by Mrs. A. J. Duniway, was that women needed to be loved, as husbands were commanded to do by Ephesians 5, if they were to submit.^[*The New Northwest* (Portland, OR), [08 March 1878](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84022673/1878-03-08/ed-1/seq-1/#words=wives+submit+unto+husbands+unto+lord). Women could, however, succeed in "governing husbands," as a few tongue in cheek articles put it, if they tried a different tack. If she avoided "smart and pert opposition," and instead submits to him and puts his judgement over her, then "he melts with tenderness and love; he is at my feet."^[The North-Carolina Standard (Raleigh, NC), [12 March 1845](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85042147/1845-03-12/ed-1/seq-1/#words=wives+submit+unto+husbands+unto+lord).]

This passage in Ephesians 5 had a number of other potential applications: to understanding the importance of the church and to explaining husband's responsiblities to their wives. By and large, the examples of quotation that made it into newspapers did not address these questions. There were a few exceptions, such as the report of an ordination ceremony in the Methodist Episcopal Church which used this text.^[*National Republican* (Washington, DC), [08 March 1875](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86053573/1875-03-08/ed-1/seq-1/#words=wives+submit+unto+husbands+unto+lord).] The verse did frequently call for husbands to love their wives, an element of the text which could scarcely be avoided, and which was part of the theory about how women's submisision should work.^[*Highland Weekly News* (Hillsborough, Ohio), [21 Feb. 1861](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85038158/1861-02-21/ed-1/seq-1/#words=wives+submit+unto+husbands+unto+lord).] But it as rare that an essay or sermon was published that was primarily about a man's duties, rather than a woman's.

So long as slavery was the predominent issue, the questions of authority had to be understood in terms of it. And the abolitionist argument was the the ten commandments made the family the first institution, and slavery destroyed that first institution including by making it impossible for women to submit. https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84027253/1863-03-13/ed-1/seq-1/#words=wives+submit+unto+husbands+unto+lord
