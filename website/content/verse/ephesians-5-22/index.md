As the 1870s began, the topic of women's rights, and specifically of a woman's right to vote, was a matter of common public discussion. The fifteenth amendment, ratified in 1870, gave black men the right to vote but it ignored the question of women's suffrage. The founding of the National Women's Suffrage Association and the American Woman Suffrage Association institutionalized the pursuit of women's suffrage. The question of women's suffrage among activists for political reform was no longer one that could be ignored, as it had been shunted aside in the pursuit of emancipation and black male suffrage.

Yet it was by no means the situation that the case for women's suffrage, or more broadly an adjustment of women's role in familial and cultural settings, was felt to be necessary or obvious. Both American Protestantism and American society more generally had long discussed the roles of women. By the early republic, the assumption was that women's roles ought primarily to be domestic. American Christianity, especially the endless array of benevolence and auxiliary movements to the church, did give women a source of authority and action in public, though even there the authority was often assumed to come from women's domestic role.^[Cite Zagarri, Revolutionary Backlash; Brekus on female preachers.]

A robust, fleshed out discussion of women's roles was a common feature of sermons, newspapers, and the like from the early republic on. The key text that was often used was Ephesians 5:22, "Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands." While other texts like Colossians 3:18 or TODO were also prominent, this text was especially important because it was used to ground women's identity in terms of the marriage relationship and in terms of submission. That text enjoyed a longtime and longspread usage as a tool for explaining women's role, which would then come to be challenged by women's suffrage and first-wave feminism, only to be reasserted with all the more vigor.

BEAT 1: How the verse was used to establish women's role

Whenever the role of women in society was discussed from a Christian perspective, Ephesians 5:22 was usually chief among the key texts that were used. In sermons, but also in essays and editorials published in newspapers, the meaning people ascribed to the verse was explained. The lines of the interpretative consensus were fairly clear. One of the chief ideas about "the New Testament woman" was that the home was the "sphere of her activities and ministries" and that the woman should "spontaneously and joyfully recognizes the husband as head of the household." In contrast to the joyfulness with which women were to accept their role, there was an implication that some women did not: "The New Testament woman is not of those who call the proper headship of the husband, tyranny, and the corresponding subjections of the wife, slavery, and seek emancipation and elevation in a persistent loud-mouthed cry for equality."^[_Lamoille Newsdealer_ (Hyde Park, VT), [01 Feb. 1870](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84023428/1870-02-01/ed-1/seq-1/#words=wives+submit+unto+husbands+unto+lord).]

These sermons and essays had to acknowledge that submission was not likely to come be easy, even if it was supposed to be joyful. Why should women be expected to submit to their husbands? The common answer was that submission was not in fact natural for women, just as love was not natural for men. Men, who had "stern, strong natures" and a "high sense of manliness" had to learn how to love. A woman, on the other hand "needs no special encouragement to love," because that was here nature. But by nature she was inclined to rebellion, and so she need encouragement to "subordination" and "submission."^[The Gold Leaf (Henderson, NC), [29 Aug. 1895](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn91068402/1895-08-29/ed-1/seq-1/#words=wives+submit+unto+husbands+unto+lord).] The answer, in other words, was that both men and women had fixed natures, and that Ephesians 5 was targeted at the failings in each.  Women's fixed nature, which desired to master her husband rather than submit to him, was sometimes explicitly connected to the fall, and the curse God put on Eve in Genesis 3:16 (TODO create link) ("I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.") That verse was often interpreted to mean that women's desire would be to rule over their husband, rather than by ruled by him. The key, as told in a serialized Christian fiction called _Her Lot; or, How She Was Protected_, by Mrs. A. J. Duniway, was that women needed to be loved, as husbands were commanded to do by Ephesians 5, if they were to submit.^[_The New Northwest_ (Portland, OR), [08 March 1878](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84022673/1878-03-08/ed-1/seq-1/#words=wives+submit+unto+husbands+unto+lord). Women could, however, succeed in "governing husbands," as a few tongue in cheek articles put it, if they tried a different tack. If she avoided "smart and pert opposition," and instead submits to him and puts his judgement over her, then "he melts with tenderness and love; he is at my feet."^[The North-Carolina Standard (Raleigh, NC), [12 March 1845](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85042147/1845-03-12/ed-1/seq-1/#words=wives+submit+unto+husbands+unto+lord).] This passage in Ephesians 5 had a number of other potential applications: to understanding the importance of the church and to explaining husband's responsiblities to their wives. By and large, the examples of quotation that made it into newspapers did not address these questions. There were a few exceptions, such as the report of an ordination ceremony in the Methodist Episcopal Church which used this text.^[_National Republican_ (Washington, DC), [08 March 1875](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86053573/1875-03-08/ed-1/seq-1/#words=wives+submit+unto+husbands+unto+lord).] The verse did frequently call for husbands to love their wives, an element of the text which could scarcely be avoided, and which was part of the theory about how women's submisision should work.^[_Highland Weekly News_ (Hillsborough, Ohio), [21 Feb. 1861](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85038158/1861-02-21/ed-1/seq-1/#words=wives+submit+unto+husbands+unto+lord).] But it as rare that an essay or sermon was published that was primarily about a man's duties from this text, rather than a woman's.  So long as slavery was the predominent issue, the questions of authority had to be understood in terms of it. Of course this text on wive's submitting to husbands was paralleled by a subsequent verse, which enjoined slaves to submit to masters.

Abolitionists' argument was the the ten commandments made the family the first institution, and slavery destroyed that first institution including by making it impossible for women to submit. For example, the minister John H. Power claimed that "the system of slavery ... makes it _impossible_ for the enslaved to perform the duties God requests of husbands and wives, parents and children, in the decalogue." He concluded that "the decalogue---_the moral law of God_---is immutably opposed to the system of American slavery."^[_Muscatine Weekly Journal_ (Muscatine, Iowa), [13 March 1863](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84027253/1863-03-13/ed-1/seq-1/#words=wives+submit+unto+husbands+unto+lord).]

{{% fig-full src="destroy-civilization.png" caption="The Presbyterian pastor and theologian Robert Louis Dabney opposed women's rights in apocalyptic terms, saying that it would \"DESTROY CHRISTIANITY AND CIVILIZATION IN AMERICA.\" _Staunton Spectator_ (Staunton, Va.), [21 March 1871](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84024718/1871-03-21/ed-1/seq-1/#words=wives+submit+unto+husbands+unto+lord), p. 1." %}}

The other view, however, linked the bondage of women, children, and slaves as part of the benevolent purpose of God. In 1844 James Shannon, the presdent of Bacon College, a small Christian college in Harrodsburg, Kentucky, made the following argument. He argued that because human sin and "all the misery on earth originated in self-will" was in the first instance a product of "self-will," that "the philosophy of Slavery \[i\]s identified with the philosophy of Human Happiness." To curb the human will, God benevolently cursed slaves to submit to masters, children to submit to parents, and wives to submit to husbands. "Man," however could not submit to some other human, so God cursed him to submit to nature and to work for his bread ({{< vv "Genesis 3:19" >}}).^[_The Examiner_ (Louisville, Ky.), [09 Dec. 1848](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015050/1848-12-09/ed-1/seq-1/#words=wives+submit+unto+husbands+unto+lord), p. 1.] Robert Louis Dabney, a Presbyterian pastor and ardent defender of slavery and the South well after the Civil War and Emancipation, likewise tied women's submission in to slavery. Because women refused to accept their natural place, to accept "Women's Rights" was to "make up our minds to surrender our Bibles, and have an atheistic Government," with each home presided over by "an infidel woman."^[_Staunton Spectator_ (Staunton, Va.), [21 March 1871](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84024718/1871-03-21/ed-1/seq-1/), p. 1.]

BEAT 2: Fissures in that assumption.

However strongly entrenched the undergirding of all kinds of authority---of husbands, fathers, and masters---via this text, there was also both strong rejections of the text and different interpretations of it. For instance, when a Richmond preacher spoke from this text, he claimed that "I have been asked over and over again to leave out of the marriage ceremony the word 'obey.' My reply has been, why should I leave it out, when the Word of God has laid such specific emphasis upon that condition of the marriage contract?"^[_The Gold Leaf_ (Henderson, N.C.), [29 Aug. 1895](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn91068402/1895-08-29/ed-1/seq-1/), p. 1.] Another article attacked women who sought to revise the words "obey and serve him" out of the Book of Common Prayer.^[_Alexandria Gazette_ (Alexandria, D.C.), [08 April 1913](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85025007/1913-04-08/ed-1/seq-4/), p. 4.]

At other times, men (real or fictitious) who invoked this text were held up to ridicule. One humorous article recounted a wive's complaints about a husband who chewed tobacco; the husband lamely attempted to respond by reading Ephesians 5:22 at family devotions.^[_The Examiner_ (Louisville, Ky.), [09 Dec. 1848](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015050/1848-12-09/ed-1/seq-1/), p. 1).] Another story told of a man who heard that a woman hit her husband with a hammer, and urged a newspaper editor to print this text lest other women follow her example.^[_Chicago Daily Tribune (Chicago, Ill.), [19 March 1876](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84031492/1876-03-19/ed-1/seq-16/), p. 16.] Another article, purportedly a news report, described a man who was sued for divorce by his wife for whipping her with a ramrod. He claimed to have the right to do so on the basis of {{< vv "Ephesians 5:22" >}} and {{< vv "Proverbs 31:13" >}}. 

BEAT 3: Women's interpretations

But there was also evidence in the newspapers that women both accepted the legitimacy of the biblical text and supported women's rights.^[Du Mez, TODO.] For example, the author Elizabeth Wilson's book on _A Scriptural View of Woman's Rights_ received notice from several papers. One paper suggested that the debate over women's rights would be revived until such time as Wilson had children who otherwise occupied her.^[_Shepherdstown Register_ (Shepherdstown, Va.), [04 Dec. 1849](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84026824/1849-12-04/ed-1/seq-2/#words=wives+submit+unto+husbands+unto+lord), p. 2.] Another review, though, praised the author for having "a very intimate knowledge fo the holy volume, besides great controversial skill."^[_Cadiz Sentinel_ (Cadiz, Ohio), [26 June 1850](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84028793/1850-06-26/ed-1/seq-3/#words=wives+submit+unto+husbands+unto+lord), p. 3.]

But whenever women advanced their interpretations of the Bible, they were just as frequently refuted. Women's rights activists were attacked as supporters of free love and opponents of the home.^[_New York Herald_ (New York, N.Y.), [13 Dec. 1869](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030313/1869-12-13/ed-1/seq-6/#words=wives+submit+unto+husbands+unto+lord), p. 6.] Or they were attacked as infidels. The Bible and the suffrage could have nothing to do with one another: "We are gravely told that female suffrage has nothing to do with the Bible. So we think. They have the same affinity as water and oil. If female suffrage is right the Bible is wrong; if the Bible is right female suffrage is wrong." Lucy Stone and other women's rights activsts were specifically attacked for denying texts like Ephesians 5:22.^[_Emporia News_, (Emporia, Kan.), [09 Aug. 1867](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82016419/1867-08-09/ed-1/seq-1/#words=wives+submit+unto+husbands+unto+lord), p. 1.]

In one striking example, a newspaper article relayed mutiple layers of a debate. The _Daily Missoulian_ ran opne article in which a woman claimed that 
the "Kingdom of God knows no male or female" and that it "makes no distinction between man and woman" (a view attested to by {{< vv "Galatians 3:28" >}}). Against scriptural texts like Ephesians 5:22, she mustered other texts from the Bible. The _Missoulian_ subsequently ran a reader's refutation, in which he dismissed her counter texts with his own arguments.^[_Daily Missoulian_ (Missoula, Mont.), [13 Jan. 1914](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83025316/1914-01-13/ed-1/seq-4/#words=wives+submit+unto+husbands+unto+lord), p. 4).

{{% fig-full src="layered-texts.png" caption="" %}}

The nineteenth century saw the start of a woman's rights movement in the United States. There were essentially three poles around which opinions of texts like Ephesians 5:22 could be viewed. One view saw the text as bolstering patriarchal authority: over wives, children, and slaves. Another view accepted that interpretation as being what the Bible meant, and therefore rejected the Bible. A third rejected that interpretation, while upholding the Bible's authority. The image above shows, laid out in the newspaper page, the ways in which these disputes played out, with text marshalled against text, and with interpretations that saw women as equal usually coming in for opposition and ridicule. These nineteenth-century debates then set the pattern for continuing discussion of the text into the present.^[On more recent see Du Mez; Beth Barr.]
