title: Gallery of Quotations
---

Quotations of or allusions to the Bible in newspapers from the nineteenth and early twentieth-century United States were widely varied. This gallery contains examples of the more interesting kinds of quotations. While the bulk of this site is intended to understand the patterns and trends by which the Bible was quoted, each of these quotations is a text worthy of interpretation itself. You can use this gallery as an introductory guide to the ways that newspapers made use of the Bible.

When using this gallery you can do the following:

- Clicking on the image of the quotation will give you a full-sized version.
- Follow the link for a specific reference to be taken to the trend line for that verse, which will also provide you links to other quotations of that verse.
- Follow the link to *Chronicling America* to see the quotation in the context of the newspaper page.
