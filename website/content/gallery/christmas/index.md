During Christmas and Easter, newspapers would sometimes reprint lengthy passages of Scripture. In this instance, most of several chapters from the four Gospels about Jesus' birth were reproduced, alongside a Christmas carol by Christina Rosetti. Usually these passages were reproduced without comment, likely on the assumption that the reader would be familiar with them. These quotations marked the passage of the seasons, both in terms of the Christian celebrations but also in terms of the practices of gift giving and consumption that increasingly became a hallmark of those holidays.[^1] Newspapers also commonly reproduced texts in their entirety, publishing not just news but literature, texts, advice, stories, recipes, and information literature.[^2] The poem by Rosetti and the Gospel accounts of Jesus' birth were thus linked not just by their subject matter, but by the ability to be reproduced as interesting texts by which a newspaper could appeal to its readers.
