In a speech on imperiaism, this author criticized the forceful interpretation of Mark 16:15, "Go ye into the world and preach the gospel to every creature." Rather, the author emphasized the ability to prosyletize through everyday examples of living "true Christianity" as the more appropriate method of converting the world. Imperialism is "swaggering, bullying, brutal," and the article urge missionaries to not create a negative association between imperialism and Christianity.
