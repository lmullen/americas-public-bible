In a speech on imperiaism, this author criticizes the forceful interpretation of Mark 16:15, "Go ye into the world and preach the gospel to every creature." Rather, they emphasize the ability to prosyletize through everyday examples of living "true Christianity" as the more appropriate method of converting the world. They refer to imperialism as "swaggering, bullying, [and] brutal" and urge missionaries to not create a negative association between imperialism and Christianity.
