Six months after the Civil War came to an end, President Andrew Johnson gave a proclamation in which he attributed the end of the war to God's favor over the United States, citing Proverbs 14:34. The ability to "secure the blessings of peace, unity, and harmony, with a great enlargement of civil liberty" was in Johnson's eyes, a gift from "our Heavenly Father." The proximate cause of Johnson's proclamation was the end of the Civil War, but he was participating in a long tradition of thanksgivings (and fasts) as a tool for political unity (in this case, a unity that was conspicuously absent). The text "righteousness exalteth a nation, while sin is a reproach to any people" was also used for fast days. Whether in service of feast or fast, Proverbs 13:4 was commonly used as a key text of American civil religion.
