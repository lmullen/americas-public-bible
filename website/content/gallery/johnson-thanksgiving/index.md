Just six months after the Civil War came to an end, President Andrew Johnson gave a proclamation in which he attributed the end of the war to God's favor over the United States, citing Proverbs 14:34. The ability to "secure the blessings of peace, unity, and harmony, with a great enlargement of civil liberty" was in Johnson's eyes, a gift from "our Heavenly Father." In this proclamation, Johnson not only thanks God for these blessings but recommends that the first Thursday of December be set aside as a day of national thanksgiving as a sign of collective gratitude. This suggestion further demonstrates the roots of Chistian influence in American politics and society, and how deeply the two are interwoven.
