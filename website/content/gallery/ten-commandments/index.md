This advertisement, published multiple times in *The Forest Republican* during 1872, encouraged consumers to buy dry goods exclusively from Hilbronner & Co. Imitating the Ten Commandments found in Exodus 20, this advertisement commanded buyers to shop only at Hilbronner, attempting to paint the brand as superior to both the consumer and other vendors. Should the consumer break any of these commandments, it is implied that they will not live as prosperously. 

This tongue-in-cheek advertisement is one of many examples where newspaper advertisements or articles imitated or even parodied well-known passages from the Bible.
