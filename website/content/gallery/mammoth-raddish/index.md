This Raleigh newspaper praised Mrs. James Turner for her the size of her radish, an indicator of her gardening skills. She was praised in the words of the Proverbs: "Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her" for her fulfillment of expectations of womanhood and domesticity.
