Extending Job 14:14, "If a man die, shall he live again?," to animals, this Alaskan newspaper honors the passing of a Yukon miner's sled dog. Revered as "a Pioneer of the Klondike," Faithful Jack is credited with having been essential to the United States' presence in the Yukon and "the development of this golden Northland."
