Proclaiming that "To Look Well Is A Duty," this author asserts that God must be
"a lover of the beautiful" because of the beauty of nature. They reference part
of Luke 12:17, "but Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these,"
asserting that the option of a non-beautiful creation proves that God prefers
beauty. Therefore, the maintainance of an individual's personal appearance is an
act of tribute to Him and should be continuously pursued, contrary to warnings
against vanity.
