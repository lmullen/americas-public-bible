After the sinking of the RMS Titanic on April 15, 1912, two New York women were lauded in the newspaper after they declined seats on a lifeboat. Mrs. Edith Evans gave up her seat for a stranger with two children while Mrs. Isidor Straus remained behind to drown with her husband. The author felt their actions exemplified John 15:13, that "Greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends," and deserved public acknowledgement.
