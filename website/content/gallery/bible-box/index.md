Newspapers sometimes ran columns where readers could write in with questions about the Bible or Christianity. In this "Everybody's Bible Box" column, a reader asked whether the Apostle Paul was a "woman hater" because of the verse "I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man" (1 Timothy 2:12). The columnist replied by discussing "the proper relationship between the man and the woman" presented in Ephesians 5.
