Some biblical verses were used as stock phrases or proverbial expressions. One such example is 1 Thessalonians 5:29, "Prove all things; hold fast that which is good." As stock expressions, though, they could also be used as fill-in-the-blanks where key words were changed to make the author's point. In this example, a Democrat criticizes Republican candidates for office by changing "good" to "bad."
