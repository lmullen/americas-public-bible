#### Computing Cultural Heritage in the Cloud

In fall 2021, I had the good fortune to work with the LC Labs to extend my work on _Chronicling America_ across the entire Library of Congress digital collections. You can find more about the [Computing Cultural Heritage in the Cloud](https://labs.loc.gov/work/experiments/cchc/) project at their website. You can find my work [for that project on GitHub](https://github.com/lmullen/cchc).
