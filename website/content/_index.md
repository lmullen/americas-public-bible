For most of its issues in 1902, the *Ellensburg \[Washington\] Dawn* featured a quotation from Benjamin Franklin prominently on its front page. "A Bible and a newspaper in every house," [the masthead proclaimed](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn88085012/1902-01-18/ed-1/seq-1/), "are the principal support of virtue, morality, and civil liberty." Though the quotation from Franklin was doubtless spurious, the combination of newspapers and the Bible would have been familiar to readers.

The newspaper linked itself to the Bible and the schools as a support of freedom and good government. Perhaps even more self-servingly, the newspaper also quoted prominent Protestant businessman John Wanamaker on the value of advertising." >}}

Throughout the nineteenth century and into the twentieth century, newspapers in the United States---even newspapers which were not published by a religious denomination or organization---made frequent recourse to the Bible. Newspapers printed sermons and [Sunday school lessons](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn87076843/1919-09-18/ed-1/seq-3/), and ministers offered lessons through [newspaper Bible clubs](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn93052980/1909-02-19/ed-1/seq-3/). Newspapers featured jokes whose punchlines required familiarity with the Bible. They aired political commentary that cited the Bible on all sides of a given issue. They ran features on [Thomas Jefferson's edited Bible](http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84020274/1902-06-01/ed-1/seq-44/) and [Abraham Lincoln's use of the Scripture](http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85042462/1909-02-14/ed-1/seq-53/). On [Good Friday](http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85058397/1913-03-21/ed-1/seq-5/), Easter, and [Christmas](http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045160/1871-12-25/ed-1/seq-1/) they reprinted long portions of the Scripture. They [opined on revisions to the English Bible](http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030431/1919-08-10/ed-1/seq-25/), and offered [word-by-word comparisons](http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85042331/1881-05-20/ed-1/seq-6/) of the changes in new translations. They made money from [advertisements](http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045433/1918-02-10/ed-1/seq-18/) for Bibles of every kind, and some newspapers even [sold Bibles directly](http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86071593/1916-11-15/ed-1/seq-6/) as a way of raising revenue. But most of all, newspapers quoted the Bible.

*America's Public Bible* uncovers the presence of biblical quotations in the nearly 11 million newspaper pages in the Library of Congress's *[Chronicling America](http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/)* collection. Using the [techniques of machine learning](methods.html) I have identified over 866,000 quotations of the Bible or verbal allusions to specific biblical verses on those newspaper pages. For now, the project has looked only for quotations to the [King James Version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_James_Version) (or Authorized Version) of the English Bible, by far the most commonly used Bible among American Protestants during the nineteenth century.

For over 1,700 of the most frequently quoted verses, this site offers [a way to explore](exploration.html) the trend in how frequently a biblical verse was used, with links to each quotation highlighted in the pages of *Chronicling America*. The site thus uncovers two contexts for each verse: the context of the newspaper article in which it was used, and the broader chronological context of quotations from that verse and the Bible as a whole. *America's Public Bible* brings together two strands of scholarship. On the one hand, its methodology is drawn from recent digital humanities projects which are concerned with tracking the reuse of texts. On the other hand, it draws on a deep scholarly literature on the Bible as a cultural text in American life. The Bible included tens of thousands of texts, each of which could be interpreted in many ways. The contribution this site makes is to show how thousands of biblical verses were used over nearly a century in some 56 billion words of text, revealing trends that are inaccessible to a single scholar's reading of these documents, yet enabling a close reading of the ways in which verses were put to use.

Also interpretative content.

For many Americans the Bible was a text whose meaning was self-evident, yet the Bible's role in U.S. history cannot be understood apart from the ways that Americans actually put it to use. That is why I have called this site America's *Public* Bible. By looking at uses of the Bible in newspapers, we can see which parts of the Bible were in common currency among Americans, as well as the range of interpretations that were given to those verses. Verses that could be cited without a reference (or used in jokes) indicated a kind of literacy or familiarity, and possibly a shared assumption about what those verses could be interpreted to mean. Verses that were used constantly were a shared cultural touchstone, while verses that were used only episodically reveal the tensions in a particular political or social situation. By looking at how the verses were actually used, we can see how the Bible was a contested yet common text.
