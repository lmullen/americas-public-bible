All of the elements of this website are accessible from the home page, which serves as a [table of contents](/). 

The elements of this site form an interpretative pyramid.

- At the base are quotations in the newspaper. You can browse the [gallery of quotations](/gallery/) to see examples, or see the [datasets](/#data) for a complete list.
- Those quotations are aggregated into trend lines, which are accompanied by tables of quotations. You can start by browsing the [featured verses](/#featured-verses).
- [Verse histories](/#verse-histories) take the information from the trend line and the quotations and offer brief interpretative essays on their history.
- Longer [essays](/#essays) introduce the site, its methods, and address topical questions in the history of the Bible in the United States.
