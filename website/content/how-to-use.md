This website is an interactive scholarly work, which means that it contains elements akin to a traditionally published book, but that it also contains interactive elements and other elements that take advantage of the medium of the web. All of the elements of this website are accessible from the home page, which serves as a [table of contents](/). 

The elements of this site form an interpretative pyramid, something like [the e-books that Robert Darnton envisioned](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1999/03/18/the-new-age-of-the-book/).

- At the base are quotations in the newspaper. You can browse the [gallery of quotations](/gallery/) to see examples, or see the [datasets](/#data) for a complete list.
- Those quotations are aggregated into trend lines, which are accompanied by tables of quotations. You can start by browsing the [featured verses](/#featured-verses).
- [Verse histories](/#verse-histories) take the information from the trend line and the quotations and offer brief interpretative essays on their history.
- Longer [essays](/#essays) introduce the site, its methods, and address topical questions in the history of the Bible in the United States.
