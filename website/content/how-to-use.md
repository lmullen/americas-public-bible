This website is a digital monograph, which means that it contains elements akin to a traditionally published book, but that it also contains interactive elements that take advantage of the medium of the web. All of the elements of this website are accessible from this table of contents. They include the following kinds of content:

- You can browse trends and find lists of quotations for specific verses in the verse viewer. Some featured verses are listed below, and you can also browse all of the verses.
- Longer essays introduce the site, its methods, and address topical questions in the history of the Bible in the United States.
- Verse histories take the information from the trend line and the quotations and offer brief interpretative essays on their history.
