A SINGULAR OMISSION.
In the report of the Executive Committee
of Schools and Colleges there occurs
this statement: "Florida has as yet no
institution which belonas to the Presbv
terian Church, U. S."
Palmer College, a chartered institute,
has had three years of successful work.
It is located at DeFuniak Springs. It has
a fine property, worth $35,000 to $40,000.
While it has been doing high-grade academy
work, in the main, and that from the
necessity of the field, it has had initial
college classes from the beginning, and
is making progress, slowly but surely,
towards regular college work.
Palmer College is owned by Presbyterians
and was established for Christian
Education under Presbyterian control.
The Presbytery of Florida elects a portion
of its trustees. It belongs to the
Presbyterian Church, U. S., as much as
doe3 Agnes Scott College.
The Presbyterians of West Florida?a
few of them especially?have been supporting
it at a great personal sacrifice.
The omission is more singular, as the
Secretary of the Executive Committee
was a member of the Synod of Florida,
when it heartily endorsed the movement
of Palmer College, and that,too, in the
face of his repeated personal opposition
and in his own church at Jacksonville.
