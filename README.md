# Quotation Finder | America's Public Bible


## Overview

[America's Public Bible](http://americaspublicbible.org) is a project to detect the biblical quotations in the [Chronicling America](http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/) and [19th Century U.S. Newspapers](https://www.gale.com/c/19th-century-us-newspapers) datasets of historical newspapers, then to interpret and visualize the patterns.  

This repository contains the code that extracts the features, trains the models, and finds the quotations. 

## Repository history

This repository has undergone a number of changes. The initial code for the prototype version of the site was created in 2016. That code can be found in [this tag](https://github.com/public-bible/quotation-finder/releases/tag/initial-doi-version) on the repository. Much of that code has been superseded.
