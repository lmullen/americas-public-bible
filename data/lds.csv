Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,24,19,Mosiah 24:19,Mosiah 24:19,"And in the morning the Lord caused a deep sleep to come upon the Lamanites, yea, and all their task-masters were in a profound sleep."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,24,20,Mosiah 24:20,Mosiah 24:20,"And Alma and his people departed into the wilderness; and when they had traveled all day they pitched their tents in a valley, and they called the valley Alma, because he led their way in the wilderness."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,24,21,Mosiah 24:21,Mosiah 24:21,"Yea, and in the valley of Alma they poured out their thanks to God because he had been merciful unto them, and eased their burdens, and had delivered them out of bondage; for they were in bondage, and none could deliver them except it were the Lord their God."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,24,22,Mosiah 24:22,Mosiah 24:22,"And they gave thanks to God, yea, all their men and all their women and all their children that could speak lifted their voices in the praises of their God."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,24,23,Mosiah 24:23,Mosiah 24:23,"And now the Lord said unto Alma: Haste thee and get thou and this people out of this land, for the Lamanites have awakened and do pursue thee; therefore get thee out of this land, and I will stop the Lamanites in this valley that they come no further in pursuit of this people."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,24,24,Mosiah 24:24,Mosiah 24:24,"And it came to pass that they departed out of the valley, and took their journey into the wilderness."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,25,1,Mosiah 25:1,Mosiah 25:1,And now king Mosiah caused that all the people should be gathered together.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,25,2,Mosiah 25:2,Mosiah 25:2,"Now there were not so many of the children of Nephi, or so many of those who were descendants of Nephi, as there were of the people of Zarahemla, who was a descendant of Mulek, and those who came with him into the wilderness."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,25,3,Mosiah 25:3,Mosiah 25:3,"And there were not so many of the people of Nephi and of the people of Zarahemla as there were of the Lamanites; yea, they were not half so numerous."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,25,4,Mosiah 25:4,Mosiah 25:4,"And now all the people of Nephi were assembled together, and also all the people of Zarahemla, and they were gathered together in two bodies."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,25,5,Mosiah 25:5,Mosiah 25:5,"And it came to pass that Mosiah did read, and caused to be read, the records of Zeniff to his people; yea, he read the records of the people of Zeniff, from the time they left the land of Zarahemla until they returned again."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,25,6,Mosiah 25:6,Mosiah 25:6,"And he also read the account of Alma and his brethren, and all their afflictions, from the time they left the land of Zarahemla until the time they returned again."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,25,7,Mosiah 25:7,Mosiah 25:7,"And now, when Mosiah had made an end of reading the records, his people who tarried in the land were struck with wonder and amazement."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,25,8,Mosiah 25:8,Mosiah 25:8,For they knew not what to think; for when they beheld those that had been delivered out of bondage they were filled with exceedingly great joy.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,25,9,Mosiah 25:9,Mosiah 25:9,"And again, when they thought of their brethren who had been slain by the Lamanites they were filled with sorrow, and even shed many tears of sorrow."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,25,10,Mosiah 25:10,Mosiah 25:10,"And again, when they thought of the immediate goodness of God, and his power in delivering Alma and his brethren out of the hands of the Lamanites and of bondage, they did raise their voices and give thanks to God."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,25,11,Mosiah 25:11,Mosiah 25:11,"And again, when they thought upon the Lamanites, who were their brethren, of their sinful and polluted state, they were filled with pain and anguish for the welfare of their souls."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,25,12,Mosiah 25:12,Mosiah 25:12,"And it came to pass that those who were the children of Amulon and his brethren, who had taken to wife the daughters of the Lamanites, were displeased with the conduct of their fathers, and they would no longer be called by the names of their fathers, therefore they took upon themselves the name of Nephi, that they might be called the children of Nephi and be numbered among those who were called Nephites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,25,13,Mosiah 25:13,Mosiah 25:13,"And now all the people of Zarahemla were numbered with the Nephites, and this because the kingdom had been conferred upon none but those who were descendants of Nephi."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,25,14,Mosiah 25:14,Mosiah 25:14,"And now it came to pass that when Mosiah had made an end of speaking and reading to the people, he desired that Alma should also speak to the people."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,25,15,Mosiah 25:15,Mosiah 25:15,"And Alma did speak unto them, when they were assembled together in large bodies, and he went from one body to another, preaching unto the people repentance and faith on the Lord."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,25,16,Mosiah 25:16,Mosiah 25:16,"And he did exhort the people of Limhi and his brethren, all those that had been delivered out of bondage, that they should remember that it was the Lord that did deliver them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,25,17,Mosiah 25:17,Mosiah 25:17,"And it came to pass that after Alma had taught the people many things, and had made an end of speaking to them, that king Limhi was desirous that he might be baptized; and all his people were desirous that they might be baptized also."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,25,18,Mosiah 25:18,Mosiah 25:18,"Therefore, Alma did go forth into the water and did baptize them; yea, he did baptize them after the manner he did his brethren in the waters of Mormon; yea, and as many as he did baptize did belong to the church of God; and this because of their belief on the words of Alma."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,25,19,Mosiah 25:19,Mosiah 25:19,And it came to pass that king Mosiah granted unto Alma that he might establish churches throughout all the land of Zarahemla; and gave him power to ordain priests and teachers over every church.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,25,20,Mosiah 25:20,Mosiah 25:20,Now this was done because there were so many people that they could not all be governed by one teacher; neither could they all hear the word of God in one assembly;
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,25,21,Mosiah 25:21,Mosiah 25:21,"Therefore they did assemble themselves together in different bodies, being called churches; every church having their priests and their teachers, and every priest preaching the word according as it was delivered to him by the mouth of Alma."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,25,22,Mosiah 25:22,Mosiah 25:22,"And thus, notwithstanding there being many churches they were all one church, yea, even the church of God; for there was nothing preached in all the churches except it were repentance and faith in God."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,25,23,Mosiah 25:23,Mosiah 25:23,"And now there were seven churches in the land of Zarahemla. And it came to pass that whosoever were desirous to take upon them the name of Christ, or of God, they did join the churches of God;"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,25,24,Mosiah 25:24,Mosiah 25:24,"And they were called the people of God. And the Lord did pour out his Spirit upon them, and they were blessed, and prospered in the land."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,26,1,Mosiah 26:1,Mosiah 26:1,"Now it came to pass that there were many of the rising generation that could not understand the words of king Benjamin, being little children at the time he spake unto his people; and they did not believe the tradition of their fathers."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,26,3,Mosiah 26:3,Mosiah 26:3,And now because of their unbelief they could not understand the word of God; and their hearts were hardened.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,26,4,Mosiah 26:4,Mosiah 26:4,"And they would not be baptized; neither would they join the church. And they were a separate people as to their faith, and remained so ever after, even in their carnal and sinful state; for they would not call upon the Lord their God."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,26,5,Mosiah 26:5,Mosiah 26:5,And now in the reign of Mosiah they were not half so numerous as the people of God; but because of the dissensions among the brethren they became more numerous.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,26,6,Mosiah 26:6,Mosiah 26:6,"For it came to pass that they did deceive many with their flattering words, who were in the church, and did cause them to commit many sins; therefore it became expedient that those who committed sin, that were in the church, should be admonished by the church."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,26,7,Mosiah 26:7,Mosiah 26:7,"And it came to pass that they were brought before the priests, and delivered up unto the priests by the teachers; and the priests brought them before Alma, who was the high priest."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,26,8,Mosiah 26:8,Mosiah 26:8,Now king Mosiah had given Alma the authority over the church.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,26,9,Mosiah 26:9,Mosiah 26:9,"And it came to pass that Alma did not know concerning them; but there were many witnesses against them; yea, the people stood and testified of their iniquity in abundance."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,26,10,Mosiah 26:10,Mosiah 26:10,"Now there had not any such thing happened before in the church; therefore Alma was troubled in his spirit, and he caused that they should be brought before the king."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,26,11,Mosiah 26:11,Mosiah 26:11,"And he said unto the king: Behold, here are many whom we have brought before thee, who are accused of their brethren; yea, and they have been taken in divers iniquities.

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,26,12,Mosiah 26:12,Mosiah 26:12,"But king Mosiah said unto Alma: Behold, I judge them not; therefore I deliver them into thy hands to be judged."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,26,13,Mosiah 26:13,Mosiah 26:13,"And now the spirit of Alma was again troubled; and he went and inquired of the Lord what he should do concerning this matter, for he feared that he should do wrong in the sight of God."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,26,14,Mosiah 26:14,Mosiah 26:14,"And it came to pass that after he had poured out his whole soul to God, the voice of the Lord came to him, saying:"

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,27,9,Mosiah 27:9,Mosiah 27:9,And he became a great hinderment to the prosperity of the church of God; stealing away the hearts of the people; causing much dissension among the people; giving a chance for the enemy of God to exercise his power over them.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,27,10,Mosiah 27:10,Mosiah 27:10,"And now it came to pass that while he was going about to destroy the church of God, for he did go about secretly with the sons of Mosiah seeking to destroy the church, and to lead astray the people of the Lord, contrary to the commandments of God, or even the king--"

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,27,32,Mosiah 27:32,Mosiah 27:32,"And now it came to pass that Alma began from this time forward to teach the people, and those who were with Alma at the time the angel appeared unto them, traveling round about through all the land, publishing to all the people the things which they had heard and seen, and preaching the word of God in much tribulation, being greatly persecuted by those who were unbelievers, being smitten by many of them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,27,33,Mosiah 27:33,Mosiah 27:33,"But notwithstanding all this, they did impart much consolation to the church, confirming their faith, and exhorting them with long-suffering and much travail to keep the commandments of God."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,27,34,Mosiah 27:34,Mosiah 27:34,"And four of them were the sons of Mosiah; and their names were Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner, and Himni; these were the names of the sons of Mosiah."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,27,35,Mosiah 27:35,Mosiah 27:35,"And they traveled throughout all the land of Zarahemla, and among all the people who were under the reign of king Mosiah, zealously striving to repair all the injuries which they had done to the church, confessing all their sins, and publishing all the things which they had seen, and explaining the prophecies and the scriptures to all who desired to hear them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,27,36,Mosiah 27:36,Mosiah 27:36,"And thus they were instruments in the hands of God in bringing many to the knowledge of the truth, yea, to the knowledge of their Redeemer."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,27,37,Mosiah 27:37,Mosiah 27:37,And how blessed are they! For they did publish peace; they did publish good tidings of good; and they did declare unto the people that the Lord reigneth.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,28,1,Mosiah 28:1,Mosiah 28:1,"Now it came to pass that after the sons of Mosiah had done all these things, they took a small number with them and returned to their father, the king, and desired of him that he would grant unto them that they might, with these whom they had selected, go up to the land of Nephi that they might preach the things which they had heard, and that they might impart the word of God to their brethren, the Lamanites--"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,28,2,Mosiah 28:2,Mosiah 28:2,"That perhaps they might bring them to the knowledge of the Lord their God, and convince them of the iniquity of their fathers; and that perhaps they might cure them of their hatred towards the Nephites, that they might also be brought to rejoice in the Lord their God, that they might become friendly to one another, and that there should be no more contentions in all the land which the Lord their God had given them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,28,3,Mosiah 28:3,Mosiah 28:3,"Now they were desirous that salvation should be declared to every creature, for they could not bear that any human soul should perish; yea, even the very thoughts that any soul should endure endless torment did cause them to quake and tremble."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,28,4,Mosiah 28:4,Mosiah 28:4,"And thus did the Spirit of the Lord work upon them, for they were the very vilest of sinners. And the Lord saw fit in his infinite mercy to spare them; nevertheless they suffered much anguish of soul because of their iniquities, suffering much and fearing that they should be cast off forever."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,28,5,Mosiah 28:5,Mosiah 28:5,And it came to pass that they did plead with their father many days that they might go up to the land of Nephi.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,28,6,Mosiah 28:6,Mosiah 28:6,And king Mosiah went and inquired of the Lord if he should let his sons go up among the Lamanites to preach the word.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,28,7,Mosiah 28:7,Mosiah 28:7,"And the Lord said unto Mosiah: Let them go up, for many shall believe on their words, and they shall have eternal life; and I will deliver thy sons out of the hands of the Lamanites."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,28,9,Mosiah 28:9,Mosiah 28:9,And they took their journey into the wilderness to go up to preach the word among the Lamanites; and I shall give an account of their proceedings hereafter.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,28,10,Mosiah 28:10,Mosiah 28:10,"Now king Mosiah had no one to confer the kingdom upon, for there was not any of his sons who would accept of the kingdom."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,28,11,Mosiah 28:11,Mosiah 28:11,"Therefore he took the records which were engraven on the plates of brass, and also the plates of Nephi, and all the things which he had kept and preserved according to the commandments of God, after having translated and caused to be written the records which were on the plates of gold which had been found by the people of Limhi, which were delivered to him by the hand of Limhi;"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,28,12,Mosiah 28:12,Mosiah 28:12,And this he did because of the great anxiety of his people; for they were desirous beyond measure to know concerning those people who had been destroyed.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,28,13,Mosiah 28:13,Mosiah 28:13,And now he translated them by the means of those two stones which were fastened into the two rims of a bow.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,28,14,Mosiah 28:14,Mosiah 28:14,"Now these things were prepared from the beginning, and were handed down from generation to generation, for the purpose of interpreting languages;"

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,28,17,Mosiah 28:17,Mosiah 28:17,"Now after Mosiah had finished translating these records, behold, it gave an account of the people who were destroyed, from the time that they were destroyed back to the building of the great tower, at the time the Lord confounded the language of the people and they were scattered abroad upon the face of all the earth, yea, and even from that time back until the creation of Adam."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,28,18,Mosiah 28:18,Mosiah 28:18,"Now this account did cause the people of Mosiah to mourn exceedingly, yea, they were filled with sorrow; nevertheless it gave them much knowledge, in the which they did rejoice."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,28,19,Mosiah 28:19,Mosiah 28:19,"And this account shall be written hereafter; for behold, it is expedient that all people should know the things which are written in this account."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,28,20,Mosiah 28:20,Mosiah 28:20,"And now, as I said unto you, that after king Mosiah had done these things, he took the plates of brass, and all the things which he had kept, and conferred them upon Alma, who was the son of Alma; yea, all the records, and also the interpreters, and conferred them upon him, and commanded him that he should keep and preserve them, and also keep a record of the people, handing them down from one generation to another, even as they had been handed down from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,29,1,Mosiah 29:1,Mosiah 29:1,"Now when Mosiah had done this he sent out throughout all the land, among all the people, desiring to know their will concerning who should be their king."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,29,3,Mosiah 29:3,Mosiah 29:3,"Now Aaron had gone up to the land of Nephi, therefore the king could not confer the kingdom upon him; neither would Aaron take upon him the kingdom; neither were any of the sons of Mosiah willing to take upon them the kingdom."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,29,4,Mosiah 29:4,Mosiah 29:4,"Therefore king Mosiah sent again among the people; yea, even a written word sent he among the people. And these were the words that were written, saying:"

And who knoweth but what my son, to whom the kingdom doth belong, should turn to be angry and draw away a part of this people after him, which would cause wars and contentions among you, which would be the cause of shedding much blood and perverting the way of the Lord, yea, and destroy the souls of many people."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,29,8,Mosiah 29:8,Mosiah 29:8,"Now I say unto you let us be wise and consider these things, for we have no right to destroy my son, neither should we have any right to destroy another if he should be appointed in his stead."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,29,9,Mosiah 29:9,Mosiah 29:9,"And if my son should turn again to his pride and vain things he would recall the things which he had said, and claim his right to the kingdom, which would cause him and also this people to commit much sin."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,29,12,Mosiah 29:12,Mosiah 29:12,"Now it is better that a man should be judged of God than of man, for the judgments of God are always just, but the judgments of man are not always just."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,29,13,Mosiah 29:13,Mosiah 29:13,"Therefore, if it were possible that you could have just men to be your kings, who would establish the laws of God, and judge this people according to his commandments, yea, if ye could have men for your kings who would do even as my father Benjamin did for this people--I say unto you, if this could always be the case then it would be expedient that ye should always have kings to rule over you."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,1,26,Alma 1:26,Alma 1:26,"And when the priests left their labor to impart the word of God unto the people, the people also left their labors to hear the word of God. And when the priest had imparted unto them the word of God they all returned again diligently unto their labors; and the priest, not esteeming himself above his hearers, for the preacher was no better than the hearer, neither was the teacher any better than the learner; and thus they were all equal, and they did all labor, every man according to his strength."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,1,27,Alma 1:27,Alma 1:27,"And they did impart of their substance, every man according to that which he had, to the poor, and the needy, and the sick, and the afflicted; and they did not wear costly apparel, yet they were neat and comely."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,1,28,Alma 1:28,Alma 1:28,"And thus they did establish the affairs of the church; and thus they began to have continual peace again, notwithstanding all their persecutions."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,1,29,Alma 1:29,Alma 1:29,"And now, because of the steadiness of the church they began to be exceedingly rich, having abundance of all things whatsoever they stood in need--an abundance of flocks and herds, and fatlings of every kind, and also abundance of grain, and of gold, and of silver, and of precious things, and abundance of silk and fine-twined linen, and all manner of good homely cloth."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,1,30,Alma 1:30,Alma 1:30,"And thus, in their prosperous circumstances, they did not send away any who were naked, or that were hungry, or that were athirst, or that were sick, or that had not been nourished; and they did not set their hearts upon riches; therefore they were liberal to all, both old and young, both bond and free, both male and female, whether out of the church or in the church, having no respect to persons as to those who stood in need."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,1,31,Alma 1:31,Alma 1:31,And thus they did prosper and become far more wealthy than those who did not belong to their church.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,1,32,Alma 1:32,Alma 1:32,"For those who did not belong to their church did indulge themselves in sorceries, and in idolatry or idleness, and in babblings, and in envyings and strife; wearing costly apparel; being lifted up in the pride of their own eyes; persecuting, lying, thieving, robbing, committing whoredoms, and murdering, and all manner of wickedness; nevertheless, the law was put in force upon all those who did transgress it, inasmuch as it was possible."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,1,33,Alma 1:33,Alma 1:33,"And it came to pass that by thus exercising the law upon them, every man suffering according to that which he had done, they became more still, and durst not commit any wickedness if it were known; therefore, there was much peace among the people of Nephi until the fifth year of the reign of the judges."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,2,1,Alma 2:1,Alma 2:1,"And it came to pass in the commencement of the fifth year of their reign there began to be a contention among the people; for a certain man, being called Amlici, he being a very cunning man, yea, a wise man as to the wisdom of the world, he being after the order of the man that slew Gideon by the sword, who was executed according to the law--"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,2,2,Alma 2:2,Alma 2:2,"Now this Amlici had, by his cunning, drawn away much people after him; even so much that they began to be very powerful; and they began to endeavor to establish Amlici to be a king over the people."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,2,3,Alma 2:3,Alma 2:3,"Now this was alarming to the people of the church, and also to all those who had not been drawn away after the persuasions of Amlici; for they knew that according to their law that such things must be established by the voice of the people."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,2,4,Alma 2:4,Alma 2:4,"Therefore, if it were possible that Amlici should gain the voice of the people, he, being a wicked man, would deprive them of their rights and privileges of the church; for it was his intent to destroy the church of God."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,2,5,Alma 2:5,Alma 2:5,"And it came to pass that the people assembled themselves together throughout all the land, every man according to his mind, whether it were for or against Amlici, in separate bodies, having much dispute and wonderful contentions one with another."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,2,6,Alma 2:6,Alma 2:6,And thus they did assemble themselves together to cast in their voices concerning the matter; and they were laid before the judges.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,2,7,Alma 2:7,Alma 2:7,"And it came to pass that the voice of the people came against Amlici, that he was not made king over the people."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,2,8,Alma 2:8,Alma 2:8,Now this did cause much joy in the hearts of those who were against him; but Amlici did stir up those who were in his favor to anger against those who were not in his favor.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,2,9,Alma 2:9,Alma 2:9,"And it came to pass that they gathered themselves together, and did consecrate Amlici to be their king."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,2,10,Alma 2:10,Alma 2:10,Now when Amlici was made king over them he commanded them that they should take up arms against their brethren; and this he did that he might subject them to him.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,2,11,Alma 2:11,Alma 2:11,"Now the people of Amlici were distinguished by the name of Amlici, being called Amlicites; and the remainder were called Nephites, or the people of God."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,2,12,Alma 2:12,Alma 2:12,"Therefore the people of the Nephites were aware of the intent of the Amlicites, and therefore they did prepare to meet them; yea, they did arm themselves with swords, and with cimeters, and with bows, and with arrows, and with stones, and with slings, and with all manner of weapons of war, of every kind."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,2,13,Alma 2:13,Alma 2:13,"And thus they were prepared to meet the Amlicites at the time of their coming. And there were appointed captains, and higher captains, and chief captains, according to their numbers."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,2,14,Alma 2:14,Alma 2:14,"And it came to pass that Amlici did arm his men with all manner of weapons of war of every kind; and he also appointed rulers and leaders over his people, to lead them to war against their brethren."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,2,15,Alma 2:15,Alma 2:15,"And it came to pass that the Amlicites came upon the hill Amnihu, which was east of the river Sidon, which ran by the land of Zarahemla, and there they began to make war with the Nephites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,2,16,Alma 2:16,Alma 2:16,"Now Alma, being the chief judge and the governor of the people of Nephi, therefore he went up with his people, yea, with his captains, and chief captains, yea, at the head of his armies, against the Amlicites to battle."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,2,17,Alma 2:17,Alma 2:17,"And they began to slay the Amlicites upon the hill east of Sidon. And the Amlicites did contend with the Nephites with great strength, insomuch that many of the Nephites did fall before the Amlicites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,2,18,Alma 2:18,Alma 2:18,"Nevertheless the Lord did strengthen the hand of the Nephites, that they slew the Amlicites with great slaughter, that they began to flee before them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,2,19,Alma 2:19,Alma 2:19,"And it came to pass that the Nephites did pursue the Amlicites all that day, and did slay them with much slaughter, insomuch that there were slain of the Amlicites twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two souls; and there were slain of the Nephites six thousand five hundred sixty and two souls."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,2,20,Alma 2:20,Alma 2:20,"And it came to pass that when Alma could pursue the Amlicites no longer he caused that his people should pitch their tents in the valley of Gideon, the valley being called after that Gideon who was slain by the hand of Nehor with the sword; and in this valley the Nephites did pitch their tents for the night."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,2,21,Alma 2:21,Alma 2:21,"And Alma sent spies to follow the remnant of the Amlicites, that he might know of their plans and their plots, whereby he might guard himself against them, that he might preserve his people from being destroyed."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,2,22,Alma 2:22,Alma 2:22,"Now those whom he had sent out to watch the camp of the Amlicites were called Zeram, and Amnor, and Manti, and Limher; these were they who went out with their men to watch the camp of the Amlicites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,2,23,Alma 2:23,Alma 2:23,"And it came to pass that on the morrow they returned into the camp of the Nephites in great haste, being greatly astonished, and struck with much fear, saying:"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,2,24,Alma 2:24,Alma 2:24,"Behold, we followed the camp of the Amlicites, and to our great astonishment, in the land of Minon, above the land of Zarahemla, in the course of the land of Nephi, we saw a numerous host of the Lamanites; and behold, the Amlicites have joined them;"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,2,25,Alma 2:25,Alma 2:25,"And they are upon our brethren in that land; and they are fleeing before them with their flocks, and their wives, and their children, towards our city; and except we make haste they obtain possession of our city, and our fathers, and our wives, and our children be slain."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,2,26,Alma 2:26,Alma 2:26,"And it came to pass that the people of Nephi took their tents, and departed out of the valley of Gideon towards their city, which was the city of Zarahemla."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,2,27,Alma 2:27,Alma 2:27,"And behold, as they were crossing the river Sidon, the Lamanites and the Amlicites, being as numerous almost, as it were, as the sands of the sea, came upon them to destroy them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,2,28,Alma 2:28,Alma 2:28,"Nevertheless, the Nephites being strengthened by the hand of the Lord, having prayed mightily to him that he would deliver them out of the hands of their enemies, therefore the Lord did hear their cries, and did strengthen them, and the Lamanites and the Amlicites did fall before them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,2,29,Alma 2:29,Alma 2:29,"And it came to pass that Alma fought with Amlici with the sword, face to face; and they did contend mightily, one with another."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,2,30,Alma 2:30,Alma 2:30,"And it came to pass that Alma, being a man of God, being exercised with much faith, cried, saying: O Lord, have mercy and spare my life, that I may be an instrument in thy hands to save and preserve this people."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,2,31,Alma 2:31,Alma 2:31,"Now when Alma had said these words he contended again with Amlici; and he was strengthened, insomuch that he slew Amlici with the sword."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,2,32,Alma 2:32,Alma 2:32,And he also contended with the king of the Lamanites; but the king of the Lamanites fled back from before Alma and sent his guards to contend with Alma.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,2,33,Alma 2:33,Alma 2:33,"But Alma, with his guards, contended with the guards of the king of the Lamanites until he slew and drove them back."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,2,34,Alma 2:34,Alma 2:34,"And thus he cleared the ground, or rather the bank, which was on the west of the river Sidon, throwing the bodies of the Lamanites who had been slain into the waters of Sidon, that thereby his people might have room to cross and contend with the Lamanites and the Amlicites on the west side of the river Sidon."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,2,35,Alma 2:35,Alma 2:35,"And it came to pass that when they had all crossed the river Sidon that the Lamanites and the Amlicites began to flee before them, notwithstanding they were so numerous that they could not be numbered."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,2,36,Alma 2:36,Alma 2:36,"And they fled before the Nephites towards the wilderness which was west and north, away beyond the borders of the land; and the Nephites did pursue them with their might, and did slay them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,2,37,Alma 2:37,Alma 2:37,"Yea, they were met on every hand, and slain and driven, until they were scattered on the west, and on the north, until they had reached the wilderness, which was called Hermounts; and it was that part of the wilderness which was infested by wild and ravenous beasts."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,2,38,Alma 2:38,Alma 2:38,"And it came to pass that many died in the wilderness of their wounds, and were devoured by those beasts and also the vultures of the air; and their bones have been found, and have been heaped up on the earth."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,3,1,Alma 3:1,Alma 3:1,"And it came to pass that the Nephites who were not slain by the weapons of war, after having buried those who had been slain--now the number of the slain were not numbered, because of the greatness of their number--after they had finished burying their dead they all returned to their lands, and to their houses, and their wives, and their children."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,3,2,Alma 3:2,Alma 3:2,"Now many women and children had been slain with the sword, and also many of their flocks and their herds; and also many of their fields of grain were destroyed, for they were trodden down by the hosts of men."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,3,3,Alma 3:3,Alma 3:3,"And now as many of the Lamanites and the Amlicites who had been slain upon the bank of the river Sidon were cast into the waters of Sidon; and behold their bones are in the depths of the sea, and they are many."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,3,4,Alma 3:4,Alma 3:4,"And the Amlicites were distinguished from the Nephites, for they had marked themselves with red in their foreheads after the manner of the Lamanites; nevertheless they had not shorn their heads like unto the Lamanites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,3,5,Alma 3:5,Alma 3:5,"Now the heads of the Lamanites were shorn; and they were naked, save it were skin which was girded about their loins, and also their armor, which was girded about them, and their bows, and their arrows, and their stones, and their slings, and so forth."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,3,6,Alma 3:6,Alma 3:6,"And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them because of their transgression and their rebellion against their brethren, who consisted of Nephi, Jacob, and Joseph, and Sam, who were just and holy men."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,3,7,Alma 3:7,Alma 3:7,"And their brethren sought to destroy them, therefore they were cursed; and the Lord God set a mark upon them, yea, upon Laman and Lemuel, and also the sons of Ishmael, and Ishmaelitish women."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,3,8,Alma 3:8,Alma 3:8,"And this was done that their seed might be distinguished from the seed of their brethren, that thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that they might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions which would prove their destruction."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,3,9,Alma 3:9,Alma 3:9,And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed with that of the Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,3,10,Alma 3:10,Alma 3:10,"Therefore, whosoever suffered himself to be led away by the Lamanites was called under that head, and there was a mark set upon him."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,3,11,Alma 3:11,Alma 3:11,"And it came to pass that whosoever would not believe in the tradition of the Lamanites, but believed those records which were brought out of the land of Jerusalem, and also in the tradition of their fathers, which were correct, who believed in the commandments of God and kept them, were called the Nephites, or the people of Nephi, from that time forth--"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,3,12,Alma 3:12,Alma 3:12,"And it is they who have kept the records which are true of their people, and also of the people of the Lamanites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,3,13,Alma 3:13,Alma 3:13,"Now we will return again to the Amlicites, for they also had a mark set upon them; yea, they set the mark upon themselves, yea, even a mark of red upon their foreheads."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,3,14,Alma 3:14,Alma 3:14,"Thus the word of God is fulfilled, for these are the words which he said to Nephi: Behold, the Lamanites have I cursed, and I will set a mark on them that they and their seed may be separated from thee and thy seed, from this time henceforth and forever, except they repent of their wickedness and turn to me that I may have mercy upon them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,3,15,Alma 3:15,Alma 3:15,"And again: I will set a mark upon him that mingleth his seed with thy brethren, that they may be cursed also."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,3,16,Alma 3:16,Alma 3:16,And again: I will set a mark upon him that fighteth against thee and thy seed.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,3,17,Alma 3:17,Alma 3:17,"And again, I say he that departeth from thee shall no more be called thy seed; and I will bless thee, and whomsoever shall be called thy seed, henceforth and forever; and these were the promises of the Lord unto Nephi and to his seed."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,3,18,Alma 3:18,Alma 3:18,Now the Amlicites knew not that they were fulfilling the words of God when they began to mark themselves in their foreheads; nevertheless they had come out in open rebellion against God; therefore it was expedient that the curse should fall upon them.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,3,19,Alma 3:19,Alma 3:19,Now I would that ye should see that they brought upon themselves the curse; and even so doth every man that is cursed bring upon himself his own condemnation.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,3,20,Alma 3:20,Alma 3:20,"Now it came to pass that not many days after the battle which was fought in the land of Zarahemla, by the Lamanites and the Amlicites, that there was another army of the Lamanites came in upon the people of Nephi, in the same place where the first army met the Amlicites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,3,21,Alma 3:21,Alma 3:21,And it came to pass that there was an army sent to drive them out of their land.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,3,22,Alma 3:22,Alma 3:22,Now Alma himself being afflicted with a wound did not go up to battle at this time against the Lamanites;
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,3,23,Alma 3:23,Alma 3:23,"But he sent up a numerous army against them; and they went up and slew many of the Lamanites, and drove the remainder of them out of the borders of their land."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,3,24,Alma 3:24,Alma 3:24,"And then they returned again and began to establish peace in the land, being troubled no more for a time with their enemies."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,3,25,Alma 3:25,Alma 3:25,"Now all these things were done, yea, all these wars and contentions were commenced and ended in the fifth year of the reign of the judges."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,3,26,Alma 3:26,Alma 3:26,"And in one year were thousands and tens of thousands of souls sent to the eternal world, that they might reap their rewards according to their works, whether they were good or whether they were bad, to reap eternal happiness or eternal misery, according to the spirit which they listed to obey, whether it be a good spirit or a bad one."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,3,27,Alma 3:27,Alma 3:27,"For every man receiveth wages of him whom he listeth to obey, and this according to the words of the spirit of prophecy; therefore let it be according to the truth. And thus endeth the fifth year of the reign of the judges."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,4,1,Alma 4:1,Alma 4:1,"Now it came to pass in the sixth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, there were no contentions nor wars in the land of Zarahemla;"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,4,2,Alma 4:2,Alma 4:2,"But the people were afflicted, yea, greatly afflicted for the loss of their brethren, and also for the loss of their flocks and herds, and also for the loss of their fields of grain, which were trodden under foot and destroyed by the Lamanites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,4,3,Alma 4:3,Alma 4:3,And so great were their afflictions that every soul had cause to mourn; and they believed that it was the judgments of God sent upon them because of their wickedness and their abominations; therefore they were awakened to a remembrance of their duty.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,4,4,Alma 4:4,Alma 4:4,"And they began to establish the church more fully; yea, and many were baptized in the waters of Sidon and were joined to the church of God; yea, they were baptized by the hand of Alma, who had been consecrated the high priest over the people of the church, by the hand of his father Alma."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,4,5,Alma 4:5,Alma 4:5,And it came to pass in the seventh year of the reign of the judges there were about three thousand five hundred souls that united themselves to the church of God and were baptized. And thus ended the seventh year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi; and there was continual peace in all that time.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,4,6,Alma 4:6,Alma 4:6,"And it came to pass in the eighth year of the reign of the judges, that the people of the church began to wax proud, because of their exceeding riches, and their fine silks, and their fine-twined linen, and because of their many flocks and herds, and their gold and their silver, and all manner of precious things, which they had obtained by their industry; and in all these things were they lifted up in the pride of their eyes, for they began to wear very costly apparel."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,4,7,Alma 4:7,Alma 4:7,"Now this was the cause of much affliction to Alma, yea, and to many of the people whom Alma had consecrated to be teachers, and priests, and elders over the church; yea, many of them were sorely grieved for the wickedness which they saw had begun to be among their people."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,4,8,Alma 4:8,Alma 4:8,"For they saw and beheld with great sorrow that the people of the church began to be lifted up in the pride of their eyes, and to set their hearts upon riches and upon the vain things of the world, that they began to be scornful, one towards another, and they began to persecute those that did not believe according to their own will and pleasure."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,4,9,Alma 4:9,Alma 4:9,"And thus, in this eighth year of the reign of the judges, there began to be great contentions among the people of the church; yea, there were envyings, and strife, and malice, and persecutions, and pride, even to exceed the pride of those who did not belong to the church of God."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,4,10,Alma 4:10,Alma 4:10,And thus ended the eighth year of the reign of the judges; and the wickedness of the church was a great stumbling-block to those who did not belong to the church; and thus the church began to fail in its progress.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,4,11,Alma 4:11,Alma 4:11,"And it came to pass in the commencement of the ninth year, Alma saw the wickedness of the church, and he saw also that the example of the church began to lead those who were unbelievers on from one piece of iniquity to another, thus bringing on the destruction of the people."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,4,12,Alma 4:12,Alma 4:12,"Yea, he saw great inequality among the people, some lifting themselves up with their pride, despising others, turning their backs upon the needy and the naked and those who were hungry, and those who were athirst, and those who were sick and afflicted."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,4,13,Alma 4:13,Alma 4:13,"Now this was a great cause for lamentations among the people, while others were abasing themselves, succoring those who stood in need of their succor, such as imparting their substance to the poor and the needy, feeding the hungry, and suffering all manner of afflictions, for Christ's sake, who should come according to the spirit of prophecy;"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,4,14,Alma 4:14,Alma 4:14,"Looking forward to that day, thus retaining a remission of their sins; being filled with great joy because of the resurrection of the dead, according to the will and power and deliverance of Jesus Christ from the bands of death."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,4,15,Alma 4:15,Alma 4:15,"And now it came to pass that Alma, having seen the afflictions of the humble followers of God, and the persecutions which were heaped upon them by the remainder of his people, and seeing all their inequality, began to be very sorrowful; nevertheless the Spirit of the Lord did not fail him."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,4,16,Alma 4:16,Alma 4:16,"And he selected a wise man who was among the elders of the church, and gave him power according to the voice of the people, that he might have power to enact laws according to the laws which had been given, and to put them in force according to the wickedness and the crimes of the people."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,4,17,Alma 4:17,Alma 4:17,"Now this man's name was Nephihah, and he was appointed chief judge; and he sat in the judgment-seat to judge and to govern the people."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,4,18,Alma 4:18,Alma 4:18,"Now Alma did not grant unto him the office of being high priest over the church, but he retained the office of high priest unto himself; but he delivered the judgment-seat unto Nephihah."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,4,19,Alma 4:19,Alma 4:19,"And this he did that he himself might go forth among his people, or among the people of Nephi, that he might preach the word of God unto them, to stir them up in remembrance of their duty, and that he might pull down, by the word of God, all the pride and craftiness and all the contentions which were among his people, seeing no way that he might reclaim them save it were in bearing down in pure testimony against them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,4,20,Alma 4:20,Alma 4:20,"And thus in the commencement of the ninth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, Alma delivered up the judgment-seat to Nephihah, and confined himself wholly to the high priesthood of the holy order of God, to the testimony of the word, according to the spirit of revelation and prophecy."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,5,1,Alma 5:1,Alma 5:1,"Now it came to pass that Alma began to deliver the word of God unto the people, first in the land of Zarahemla, and from thence throughout all the land."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,5,2,Alma 5:2,Alma 5:2,"And these are the words which he spake to the people in the church which was established in the city of Zarahemla, according to his own record, saying:"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,5,3,Alma 5:3,Alma 5:3,"I, Alma, having been consecrated by my father, Alma, to be a high priest over the church of God, he having power and authority from God to do these things, behold, I say unto you that he began to establish a church in the land which was in the borders of Nephi; yea, the land which was called the land of Mormon; yea, and he did baptize his brethren in the waters of Mormon."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,5,4,Alma 5:4,Alma 5:4,"And behold, I say unto you, they were delivered out of the hands of the people of king Noah, by the mercy and power of God."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,5,5,Alma 5:5,Alma 5:5,"And behold, after that, they were brought into bondage by the hands of the Lamanites in the wilderness; yea, I say unto you, they were in captivity, and again the Lord did deliver them out of bondage by the power of his word; and we were brought into this land, and here we began to establish the church of God throughout this land also."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,5,6,Alma 5:6,Alma 5:6,"And now behold, I say unto you, my brethren, you that belong to this church, have you sufficiently retained in remembrance the captivity of your fathers? Yea, and have you sufficiently retained in remembrance his mercy and long-suffering towards them? And moreover, have ye sufficiently retained in remembrance that he has delivered their souls from hell?"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,5,7,Alma 5:7,Alma 5:7,"Behold, he changed their hearts; yea, he awakened them out of a deep sleep, and they awoke unto God. Behold, they were in the midst of darkness; nevertheless, their souls were illuminated by the light of the everlasting word; yea, they were encircled about by the bands of death, and the chains of hell, and an everlasting destruction did await them."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,8,6,Alma 8:6,Alma 8:6,"So that when he had finished his work at Melek he departed thence, and traveled three days' journey on the north of the land of Melek; and he came to a city which was called Ammonihah."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,8,7,Alma 8:7,Alma 8:7,"Now it was the custom of the people of Nephi to call their lands, and their cities, and their villages, yea, even all their small villages, after the name of him who first possessed them; and thus it was with the land of Ammonihah."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,8,8,Alma 8:8,Alma 8:8,And it came to pass that when Alma had come to the city of Ammonihah he began to preach the word of God unto them.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,8,9,Alma 8:9,Alma 8:9,Now Satan had gotten great hold upon the hearts of the people of the city of Ammonihah; therefore they would not hearken unto the words of Alma.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,8,10,Alma 8:10,Alma 8:10,"Nevertheless Alma labored much in the spirit, wrestling with God in mighty prayer, that he would pour out his Spirit upon the people who were in the city; that he would also grant that he might baptize them unto repentance."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,8,11,Alma 8:11,Alma 8:11,"Nevertheless, they hardened their hearts, saying unto him: Behold, we know that thou art Alma; and we know that thou art high priest over the church which thou hast established in many parts of the land, according to your tradition; and we are not of thy church, and we do not believe in such foolish traditions."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,8,12,Alma 8:12,Alma 8:12,And now we know that because we are not of thy church we know that thou hast no power over us; and thou hast delivered up the judgment-seat unto Nephihah; therefore thou art not the chief judge over us.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,8,13,Alma 8:13,Alma 8:13,"Now when the people had said this, and withstood all his words, and reviled him, and spit upon him, and caused that he should be cast out of their city, he departed thence and took his journey towards the city which was called Aaron."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,8,14,Alma 8:14,Alma 8:14,"And it came to pass that while he was journeying thither, being weighed down with sorrow, wading through much tribulation and anguish of soul, because of the wickedness of the people who were in the city of Ammonihah, it came to pass while Alma was thus weighed down with sorrow, behold an angel of the Lord appeared unto him, saying:"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,8,15,Alma 8:15,Alma 8:15,"Blessed art thou, Alma; therefore, lift up thy head and rejoice, for thou hast great cause to rejoice; for thou hast been faithful in keeping the commandments of God from the time which thou receivedst thy first message from him. Behold, I am he that delivered it unto you."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,8,16,Alma 8:16,Alma 8:16,"And behold, I am sent to command thee that thou return to the city of Ammonihah, and preach again unto the people of the city; yea, preach unto them. Yea, say unto them, except they repent the Lord God will destroy them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,8,17,Alma 8:17,Alma 8:17,"For behold, they do study at this time that they may destroy the liberty of thy people, (for thus saith the Lord) which is contrary to the statutes, and judgments, and commandments which he has given unto his people."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,8,18,Alma 8:18,Alma 8:18,"Now it came to pass that after Alma had received his message from the angel of the Lord he returned speedily to the land of Ammonihah. And he entered the city by another way, yea, by the way which is on the south of the city of Ammonihah."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,8,19,Alma 8:19,Alma 8:19,"And as he entered the city he was an hungered, and he said to a man: Will ye give to an humble servant of God something to eat?"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,8,20,Alma 8:20,Alma 8:20,"And the man said unto him: I am a Nephite, and I know that thou art a holy prophet of God, for thou art the man whom an angel said in a vision: Thou shalt receive. Therefore, go with me into my house and I will impart unto thee of my food; and I know that thou wilt be a blessing unto me and my house."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,8,21,Alma 8:21,Alma 8:21,And it came to pass that the man received him into his house; and the man was called Amulek; and he brought forth bread and meat and set before Alma.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,8,22,Alma 8:22,Alma 8:22,"And it came to pass that Alma ate bread and was filled; and he blessed Amulek and his house, and he gave thanks unto God."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,8,23,Alma 8:23,Alma 8:23,"And after he had eaten and was filled he said unto Amulek: I am Alma, and am the high priest over the church of God throughout the land."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,8,24,Alma 8:24,Alma 8:24,"And behold, I have been called to preach the word of God among all this people, according to the spirit of revelation and prophecy; and I was in this land and they would not receive me, but they cast me out and I was about to set my back towards this land forever."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,8,25,Alma 8:25,Alma 8:25,"But behold, I have been commanded that I should turn again and prophesy unto this people, yea, and to testify against them concerning their iniquities."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,8,26,Alma 8:26,Alma 8:26,"And now, Amulek, because thou hast fed me and taken me in, thou art blessed; for I was an hungered, for I had fasted many days."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,8,27,Alma 8:27,Alma 8:27,And Alma tarried many days with Amulek before he began to preach unto the people.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,8,28,Alma 8:28,Alma 8:28,And it came to pass that the people did wax more gross in their iniquities.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,8,29,Alma 8:29,Alma 8:29,"And the word came to Alma, saying: Go; and also say unto my servant Amulek, go forth and prophesy unto this people, saying--Repent ye, for thus saith the Lord, except ye repent I will visit this people in mine anger; yea, and I will not turn my fierce anger away."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,8,30,Alma 8:30,Alma 8:30,"And Alma went forth, and also Amulek, among the people, to declare the words of God unto them; and they were filled with the Holy Ghost."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,8,31,Alma 8:31,Alma 8:31,"And they had power given unto them, insomuch that they could not be confined in dungeons; neither was it possible that any man could slay them; nevertheless they did not exercise their power until they were bound in bands and cast into prison. Now, this was done that the Lord might show forth his power in them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,8,32,Alma 8:32,Alma 8:32,"And it came to pass that they went forth and began to preach and to prophesy unto the people, according to the spirit and power which the Lord had given them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,9,1,Alma 9:1,Alma 9:1,"And again, I, Alma, having been commanded of God that I should take Amulek and go forth and preach again unto this people, or the people who were in the city of Ammonihah, it came to pass as I began to preach unto them, they began to contend with me, saying:"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,9,2,Alma 9:2,Alma 9:2,"Who art thou? Suppose ye that we shall believe the testimony of one man, although he should preach unto us that the earth should pass away?"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,9,3,Alma 9:3,Alma 9:3,Now they understood not the words which they spake; for they knew not that the earth should pass away.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,9,4,Alma 9:4,Alma 9:4,And they said also: We will not believe thy words if thou shouldst prophesy that this great city should be destroyed in one day.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,9,5,Alma 9:5,Alma 9:5,"Now they knew not that God could do such marvelous works, for they were a hard-hearted and a stiffnecked people."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,9,6,Alma 9:6,Alma 9:6,"And they said: Who is God, that sendeth no more authority than one man among this people, to declare unto them the truth of such great and marvelous things?"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,9,7,Alma 9:7,Alma 9:7,"And they stood forth to lay their hands on me; but behold, they did not. And I stood with boldness to declare unto them, yea, I did boldly testify unto them, saying:"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,9,8,Alma 9:8,Alma 9:8,"Behold, O ye wicked and perverse generation, how have ye forgotten the tradition of your fathers; yea, how soon ye have forgotten the commandments of God."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,9,9,Alma 9:9,Alma 9:9,"Do ye not remember that our father, Lehi, was brought out of Jerusalem by the hand of God? Do ye not remember that they were all led by him through the wilderness?"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,9,10,Alma 9:10,Alma 9:10,"And have ye forgotten so soon how many times he delivered our fathers out of the hands of their enemies, and preserved them from being destroyed, even by the hands of their own brethren?"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,9,11,Alma 9:11,Alma 9:11,"Yea, and if it had not been for his matchless power, and his mercy, and his long-suffering towards us, we should unavoidably have been cut off from the face of the earth long before this period of time, and perhaps been consigned to a state of endless misery and woe."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,9,12,Alma 9:12,Alma 9:12,"Behold, now I say unto you that he commandeth you to repent; and except ye repent, ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God. But behold, this is not all--he has commanded you to repent, or he will utterly destroy you from off the face of the earth; yea, he will visit you in his anger, and in his fierce anger he will not turn away."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,9,13,Alma 9:13,Alma 9:13,"Behold, do ye not remember the words which he spake unto Lehi, saying that: Inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall prosper in the land? And again it is said that: Inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,9,14,Alma 9:14,Alma 9:14,"Now I would that ye should remember, that inasmuch as the Lamanites have not kept the commandments of God, they have been cut off from the presence of the Lord. Now we see that the word of the Lord has been verified in this thing, and the Lamanites have been cut off from his presence, from the beginning of their transgressions in the land."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,9,15,Alma 9:15,Alma 9:15,"Nevertheless I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable for them in the day of judgment than for you, if ye remain in your sins, yea, and even more tolerable for them in this life than for you, except ye repent."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,9,16,Alma 9:16,Alma 9:16,For there are many promises which are extended to the Lamanites; for it is because of the traditions of their fathers that caused them to remain in their state of ignorance; therefore the Lord will be merciful unto them and prolong their existence in the land.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,9,17,Alma 9:17,Alma 9:17,"And at some period of time they will be brought to believe in his word, and to know of the incorrectness of the traditions of their fathers; and many of them will be saved, for the Lord will be merciful unto all who call on his name."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,9,18,Alma 9:18,Alma 9:18,"But behold, I say unto you that if ye persist in your wickedness that your days shall not be prolonged in the land, for the Lamanites shall be sent upon you; and if ye repent not they shall come in a time when you know not, and ye shall be visited with utter destruction; and it shall be according to the fierce anger of the Lord."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,9,19,Alma 9:19,Alma 9:19,"For he will not suffer you that ye shall live in your iniquities, to destroy his people. I say unto you, Nay; he would rather suffer that the Lamanites might destroy all his people who are called the people of Nephi, if it were possible that they could fall into sins and transgressions, after having had so much light and so much knowledge given unto them of the Lord their God;"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,9,20,Alma 9:20,Alma 9:20,"Yea, after having been such a highly favored people of the Lord; yea, after having been favored above every other nation, kindred, tongue, or people; after having had all things made known unto them, according to their desires, and their faith, and prayers, of that which has been, and which is, and which is to come;"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,9,21,Alma 9:21,Alma 9:21,"Having been visited by the Spirit of God; having conversed with angels, and having been spoken unto by the voice of the Lord; and having the spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of revelation, and also many gifts, the gift of speaking with tongues, and the gift of preaching, and the gift of the Holy Ghost, and the gift of translation;"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,9,22,Alma 9:22,Alma 9:22,"Yea, and after having been delivered of God out of the land of Jerusalem, by the hand of the Lord; having been saved from famine, and from sickness, and all manner of diseases of every kind; and they having waxed strong in battle, that they might not be destroyed; having been brought out of bondage time after time, and having been kept and preserved until now; and they have been prospered until they are rich in all manner of things--"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,9,23,Alma 9:23,Alma 9:23,"And now behold I say unto you, that if this people, who have received so many blessings from the hand of the Lord, should transgress contrary to the light and knowledge which they do have, I say unto you that if this be the case, that if they should fall into transgression, it would be far more tolerable for the Lamanites than for them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,9,24,Alma 9:24,Alma 9:24,"For behold, the promises of the Lord are extended to the Lamanites, but they are not unto you if ye transgress; for has not the Lord expressly promised and firmly decreed, that if ye will rebel against him that ye shall utterly be destroyed from off the face of the earth?"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,9,25,Alma 9:25,Alma 9:25,"And now for this cause, that ye may not be destroyed, the Lord has sent his angel to visit many of his people, declaring unto them that they must go forth and cry mightily unto this people, saying: Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is nigh at hand;"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,9,26,Alma 9:26,Alma 9:26,"And not many days hence the Son of God shall come in his glory; and his glory shall be the glory of the Only Begotten of the Father, full of grace, equity, and truth, full of patience, mercy, and long-suffering, quick to hear the cries of his people and to answer their prayers."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,9,27,Alma 9:27,Alma 9:27,"And behold, he cometh to redeem those who will be baptized unto repentance, through faith on his name."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,9,28,Alma 9:28,Alma 9:28,"Therefore, prepare ye the way of the Lord, for the time is at hand that all men shall reap a reward of their works, according to that which they have been--if they have been righteous they shall reap the salvation of their souls, according to the power and deliverance of Jesus Christ; and if they have been evil they shall reap the damnation of their souls, according to the power and captivation of the devil."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,9,29,Alma 9:29,Alma 9:29,"Now behold, this is the voice of the angel, crying unto the people."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,9,30,Alma 9:30,Alma 9:30,"And now, my beloved brethren, for ye are my brethren, and ye ought to be beloved, and ye ought to bring forth works which are meet for repentance, seeing that your hearts have been grossly hardened against the word of God, and seeing that ye are a lost and a fallen people."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,9,31,Alma 9:31,Alma 9:31,"Now it came to pass that when I, Alma, had spoken these words, behold, the people were wroth with me because I said unto them that they were a hard-hearted and a stiffnecked people."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,9,32,Alma 9:32,Alma 9:32,"And also because I said unto them that they were a lost and a fallen people they were angry with me, and sought to lay their hands upon me, that they might cast me into prison."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,9,33,Alma 9:33,Alma 9:33,But it came to pass that the Lord did not suffer them that they should take me at that time and cast me into prison.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,9,34,Alma 9:34,Alma 9:34,"And it came to pass that Amulek went and stood forth, and began to preach unto them also. And now the words of Amulek are not all written, nevertheless a part of his words are written in this book."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,10,1,Alma 10:1,Alma 10:1,"Now these are the words which Amulek preached unto the people who were in the land of Ammonihah, saying:"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,10,2,Alma 10:2,Alma 10:2,"I am Amulek; I am the son of Giddonah, who was the son of Ishmael, who was a descendant of Aminadi; and it was the same Aminadi who interpreted the writing which was upon the wall of the temple, which was written by the finger of God."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,10,3,Alma 10:3,Alma 10:3,"And Aminadi was a descendant of Nephi, who was the son of Lehi, who came out of the land of Jerusalem, who was a descendant of Manasseh, who was the son of Joseph who was sold into Egypt by the hands of his brethren."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,10,4,Alma 10:4,Alma 10:4,"And behold, I am also a man of no small reputation among all those who know me; yea, and behold, I have many kindreds and friends, and I have also acquired much riches by the hand of my industry."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,10,5,Alma 10:5,Alma 10:5,"Nevertheless, after all this, I never have known much of the ways of the Lord, and his mysteries and marvelous power. I said I never had known much of these things; but behold, I mistake, for I have seen much of his mysteries and his marvelous power; yea, even in the preservation of the lives of this people."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,10,6,Alma 10:6,Alma 10:6,"Nevertheless, I did harden my heart, for I was called many times and I would not hear; therefore I knew concerning these things, yet I would not know; therefore I went on rebelling against God, in the wickedness of my heart, even until the fourth day of this seventh month, which is in the tenth year of the reign of the judges."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,10,7,Alma 10:7,Alma 10:7,"As I was journeying to see a very near kindred, behold an angel of the Lord appeared unto me and said: Amulek, return to thine own house, for thou shalt feed a prophet of the Lord; yea, a holy man, who is a chosen man of God; for he has fasted many days because of the sins of this people, and he is an hungered, and thou shalt receive him into thy house and feed him, and he shall bless thee and thy house; and the blessing of the Lord shall rest upon thee and thy house."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,10,8,Alma 10:8,Alma 10:8,"And it came to pass that I obeyed the voice of the angel, and returned towards my house. And as I was going thither I found the man whom the angel said unto me: Thou shalt receive into thy house--and behold it was this same man who has been speaking unto you concerning the things of God."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,10,9,Alma 10:9,Alma 10:9,And the angel said unto me he is a holy man; wherefore I know he is a holy man because it was said by an angel of God.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,10,10,Alma 10:10,Alma 10:10,"And again, I know that the things whereof he hath testified are true; for behold I say unto you, that as the Lord liveth, even so has he sent his angel to make these things manifest unto me; and this he has done while this Alma hath dwelt at my house."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,10,11,Alma 10:11,Alma 10:11,"For behold, he hath blessed mine house, he hath blessed me, and my women, and my children, and my father and my kinsfolk; yea, even all my kindred hath he blessed, and the blessing of the Lord hath rested upon us according to the words which he spake."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,10,12,Alma 10:12,Alma 10:12,"And now, when Amulek had spoken these words the people began to be astonished, seeing there was more than one witness who testified of the things whereof they were accused, and also of the things which were to come, according to the spirit of prophecy which was in them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,10,13,Alma 10:13,Alma 10:13,"Nevertheless, there were some among them who thought to question them, that by their cunning devices they might catch them in their words, that they might find witness against them, that they might deliver them to their judges that they might be judged according to the law, and that they might be slain or cast into prison, according to the crime which they could make appear or witness against them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,10,14,Alma 10:14,Alma 10:14,"Now it was those men who sought to destroy them, who were lawyers, who were hired or appointed by the people to administer the law at their times of trials, or at the trials of the crimes of the people before the judges."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,10,15,Alma 10:15,Alma 10:15,Now these lawyers were learned in all the arts and cunning of the people; and this was to enable them that they might be skilful in their profession.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,10,16,Alma 10:16,Alma 10:16,"And it came to pass that they began to question Amulek, that thereby they might make him cross his words, or contradict the words which he should speak."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,10,17,Alma 10:17,Alma 10:17,"Now they knew not that Amulek could know of their designs. But it came to pass as they began to question him, he perceived their thoughts, and he said unto them: O ye wicked and perverse generation, ye lawyers and hypocrites, for ye are laying the foundations of the devil; for ye are laying traps and snares to catch the holy ones of God."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,10,18,Alma 10:18,Alma 10:18,"Ye are laying plans to pervert the ways of the righteous, and to bring down the wrath of God upon your heads, even to the utter destruction of this people."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,10,19,Alma 10:19,Alma 10:19,"Yea, well did Mosiah say, who was our last king, when he was about to deliver up the kingdom, having no one to confer it upon, causing that this people should be governed by their own voices--yea, well did he say that if the time should come that the voice of this people should choose iniquity, that is, if the time should come that this people should fall into transgression, they would be ripe for destruction."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,10,20,Alma 10:20,Alma 10:20,"And now I say unto you that well doth the Lord judge of your iniquities; well doth he cry unto this people, by the voice of his angels: Repent ye, repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,10,21,Alma 10:21,Alma 10:21,"Yea, well doth he cry, by the voice of his angels that: I will come down among my people, with equity and justice in my hands."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,10,22,Alma 10:22,Alma 10:22,"Yea, and I say unto you that if it were not for the prayers of the righteous, who are now in the land, that ye would even now be visited with utter destruction; yet it would not be by flood, as were the people in the days of Noah, but it would be by famine, and by pestilence, and the sword."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,10,23,Alma 10:23,Alma 10:23,"But it is by the prayers of the righteous that ye are spared; now therefore, if ye will cast out the righteous from among you then will not the Lord stay his hand; but in his fierce anger he will come out against you; then ye shall be smitten by famine, and by pestilence, and by the sword; and the time is soon at hand except ye repent."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,10,24,Alma 10:24,Alma 10:24,"And now it came to pass that the people were more angry with Amulek, and they cried out, saying: This man doth revile against our laws which are just, and our wise lawyers whom we have selected."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,10,25,Alma 10:25,Alma 10:25,"But Amulek stretched forth his hand, and cried the mightier unto them, saying: O ye wicked and perverse generation, why hath Satan got such great hold upon your hearts? Why will ye yield yourselves unto him that he may have power over you, to blind your eyes, that ye will not understand the words which are spoken, according to their truth?"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,10,26,Alma 10:26,Alma 10:26,"For behold, have I testified against your law? Ye do not understand; ye say that I have spoken against your law; but I have not, but I have spoken in favor of your law, to your condemnation."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,10,27,Alma 10:27,Alma 10:27,"And now behold, I say unto you, that the foundation of the destruction of this people is beginning to be laid by the unrighteousness of your lawyers and your judges."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,10,28,Alma 10:28,Alma 10:28,"And now it came to pass that when Amulek had spoken these words the people cried out against him, saying: Now we know that this man is a child of the devil, for he hath lied unto us; for he hath spoken against our law. And now he says that he has not spoken against it."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,10,29,Alma 10:29,Alma 10:29,"And again, he has reviled against our lawyers, and our judges."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,10,30,Alma 10:30,Alma 10:30,And it came to pass that the lawyers put it into their hearts that they should remember these things against him.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,10,31,Alma 10:31,Alma 10:31,"And there was one among them whose name was Zeezrom. Now he was the foremost to accuse Amulek and Alma, he being one of the most expert among them, having much business to do among the people."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,10,32,Alma 10:32,Alma 10:32,Now the object of these lawyers was to get gain; and they got gain according to their employ.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,11,1,Alma 11:1,Alma 11:1,"Now it was in the law of Mosiah that every man who was a judge of the law, or those who were appointed to be judges, should receive wages according to the time which they labored to judge those who were brought before them to be judged."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,11,2,Alma 11:2,Alma 11:2,"Now if a man owed another, and he would not pay that which he did owe, he was complained of to the judge; and the judge executed authority, and sent forth officers that the man should be brought before him; and he judged the man according to the law and the evidences which were brought against him, and thus the man was compelled to pay that which he owed, or be stripped, or be cast out from among the people as a thief and a robber."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,11,3,Alma 11:3,Alma 11:3,"And the judge received for his wages according to his time--a senine of gold for a day, or a senum of silver, which is equal to a senine of gold; and this is according to the law which was given."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,11,4,Alma 11:4,Alma 11:4,"Now these are the names of the different pieces of their gold, and of their silver, according to their value. And the names are given by the Nephites, for they did not reckon after the manner of the Jews who were at Jerusalem; neither did they measure after the manner of the Jews; but they altered their reckoning and their measure, according to the minds and the circumstances of the people, in every generation, until the reign of the judges, they having been established by king Mosiah."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,11,5,Alma 11:5,Alma 11:5,"Now the reckoning is thus--a senine of gold, a seon of gold, a shum of gold, and a limnah of gold."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,11,6,Alma 11:6,Alma 11:6,"A senum of silver, an amnor of silver, an ezrom of silver, and an onti of silver."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,11,7,Alma 11:7,Alma 11:7,"A senum of silver was equal to a senine of gold, and either for a measure of barley, and also for a measure of every kind of grain."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,11,8,Alma 11:8,Alma 11:8,Now the amount of a seon of gold was twice the value of a senine.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,11,9,Alma 11:9,Alma 11:9,And a shum of gold was twice the value of a seon.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,11,10,Alma 11:10,Alma 11:10,And a limnah of gold was the value of them all.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,11,11,Alma 11:11,Alma 11:11,And an amnor of silver was as great as two senums.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,11,12,Alma 11:12,Alma 11:12,And an ezrom of silver was as great as four senums.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,11,13,Alma 11:13,Alma 11:13,And an onti was as great as them all.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,11,14,Alma 11:14,Alma 11:14,Now this is the value of the lesser numbers of their reckoning--
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,11,15,Alma 11:15,Alma 11:15,"A shiblon is half of a senum; therefore, a shiblon for half a measure of barley."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,11,16,Alma 11:16,Alma 11:16,And a shiblum is a half of a shiblon.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,11,17,Alma 11:17,Alma 11:17,And a leah is the half of a shiblum.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,11,18,Alma 11:18,Alma 11:18,"Now this is their number, according to their reckoning."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,11,19,Alma 11:19,Alma 11:19,Now an antion of gold is equal to three shiblons.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,11,20,Alma 11:20,Alma 11:20,"Now, it was for the sole purpose to get gain, because they received their wages according to their employ, therefore, they did stir up the people to riotings, and all manner of disturbances and wickedness, that they might have more employ, that they might get money according to the suits which were brought before them; therefore they did stir up the people against Alma and Amulek."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,11,21,Alma 11:21,Alma 11:21,"And this Zeezrom began to question Amulek, saying: Will ye answer me a few questions which I shall ask you? Now Zeezrom was a man who was expert in the devices of the devil, that he might destroy that which was good; therefore, he said unto Amulek: Will ye answer the questions which I shall put unto you?"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,11,22,Alma 11:22,Alma 11:22,"And Amulek said unto him: Yea, if it be according to the Spirit of the Lord, which is in me; for I shall say nothing which is contrary to the Spirit of the Lord. And Zeezrom said unto him: Behold, here are six onties of silver, and all these will I give thee if thou wilt deny the existence of a Supreme Being."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,11,23,Alma 11:23,Alma 11:23,"Now Amulek said: O thou child of hell, why tempt ye me? Knowest thou that the righteous yieldeth to no such temptations?"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,11,24,Alma 11:24,Alma 11:24,"Believest thou that there is no God? I say unto you, Nay, thou knowest that there is a God, but thou lovest that lucre more than him."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,11,25,Alma 11:25,Alma 11:25,"And now thou hast lied before God unto me. Thou saidst unto me--Behold these six onties, which are of great worth, I will give unto thee--when thou hadst it in thy heart to retain them from me; and it was only thy desire that I should deny the true and living God, that thou mightest have cause to destroy me. And now behold, for this great evil thou shalt have thy reward."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,11,26,Alma 11:26,Alma 11:26,And Zeezrom said unto him: Thou sayest there is a true and living God?
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,11,27,Alma 11:27,Alma 11:27,"And Amulek said: Yea, there is a true and living God."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,11,28,Alma 11:28,Alma 11:28,Now Zeezrom said: Is there more than one God?
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,11,29,Alma 11:29,Alma 11:29,"And he answered, No."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,11,30,Alma 11:30,Alma 11:30,Now Zeezrom said unto him again: How knowest thou these things?
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,11,31,Alma 11:31,Alma 11:31,And he said: An angel hath made them known unto me.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,11,32,Alma 11:32,Alma 11:32,And Zeezrom said again: Who is he that shall come? Is it the Son of God?
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,11,33,Alma 11:33,Alma 11:33,"And he said unto him, Yea."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,11,34,Alma 11:34,Alma 11:34,"And Zeezrom said again: Shall he save his people in their sins? And Amulek answered and said unto him: I say unto you he shall not, for it is impossible for him to deny his word."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,11,35,Alma 11:35,Alma 11:35,"Now Zeezrom said unto the people: See that ye remember these things; for he said there is but one God; yet he saith that the Son of God shall come, but he shall not save his people--as though he had authority to command God."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,11,36,Alma 11:36,Alma 11:36,"Now Amulek saith again unto him: Behold thou hast lied, for thou sayest that I spake as though I had authority to command God because I said he shall not save his people in their sins."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,11,37,Alma 11:37,Alma 11:37,"And I say unto you again that he cannot save them in their sins; for I cannot deny his word, and he hath said that no unclean thing can inherit the kingdom of heaven; therefore, how can ye be saved, except ye inherit the kingdom of heaven? Therefore, ye cannot be saved in your sins."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,11,38,Alma 11:38,Alma 11:38,Now Zeezrom saith again unto him: Is the Son of God the very Eternal Father?
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,11,39,Alma 11:39,Alma 11:39,"And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father of heaven and of earth, and all things which in them are; he is the beginning and the end, the first and the last;"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,11,40,Alma 11:40,Alma 11:40,"And he shall come into the world to redeem his people; and he shall take upon him the transgressions of those who believe on his name; and these are they that shall have eternal life, and salvation cometh to none else."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,11,41,Alma 11:41,Alma 11:41,"Therefore the wicked remain as though there had been no redemption made, except it be the loosing of the bands of death; for behold, the day cometh that all shall rise from the dead and stand before God, and be judged according to their works."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,11,42,Alma 11:42,Alma 11:42,"Now, there is a death which is called a temporal death; and the death of Christ shall loose the bands of this temporal death, that all shall be raised from this temporal death."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,11,43,Alma 11:43,Alma 11:43,"The spirit and the body shall be reunited again in its perfect form; both limb and joint shall be restored to its proper frame, even as we now are at this time; and we shall be brought to stand before God, knowing even as we know now, and have a bright recollection of all our guilt."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,11,44,Alma 11:44,Alma 11:44,"Now, this restoration shall come to all, both old and young, both bond and free, both male and female, both the wicked and the righteous; and even there shall not so much as a hair of their heads be lost; but every thing shall be restored to its perfect frame, as it is now, or in the body, and shall be brought and be arraigned before the bar of Christ the Son, and God the Father, and the Holy Spirit, which is one Eternal God, to be judged according to their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,11,45,Alma 11:45,Alma 11:45,"Now, behold, I have spoken unto you concerning the death of the mortal body, and also concerning the resurrection of the mortal body. I say unto you that this mortal body is raised to an immortal body, that is from death, even from the first death unto life, that they can die no more; their spirits uniting with their bodies, never to be divided; thus the whole becoming spiritual and immortal, that they can no more see corruption."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,11,46,Alma 11:46,Alma 11:46,"Now, when Amulek had finished these words the people began again to be astonished, and also Zeezrom began to tremble. And thus ended the words of Amulek, or this is all that I have written."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,12,1,Alma 12:1,Alma 12:1,"Now Alma, seeing that the words of Amulek had silenced Zeezrom, for he beheld that Amulek had caught him in his lying and deceiving to destroy him, and seeing that he began to tremble under a consciousness of his guilt, he opened his mouth and began to speak unto him, and to establish the words of Amulek, and to explain things beyond, or to unfold the scriptures beyond that which Amulek had done."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,12,2,Alma 12:2,Alma 12:2,"Now the words that Alma spake unto Zeezrom were heard by the people round about; for the multitude was great, and he spake on this wise:"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,12,3,Alma 12:3,Alma 12:3,"Now Zeezrom, seeing that thou hast been taken in thy lying and craftiness, for thou hast not lied unto men only but thou hast lied unto God; for behold, he knows all thy thoughts, and thou seest that thy thoughts are made known unto us by his Spirit;"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,12,4,Alma 12:4,Alma 12:4,"And thou seest that we know that thy plan was a very subtle plan, as to the subtlety of the devil, for to lie and to deceive this people that thou mightest set them against us, to revile us and to cast us out--"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,12,5,Alma 12:5,Alma 12:5,"Now this was a plan of thine adversary, and he hath exercised his power in thee. Now I would that ye should remember that what I say unto thee I say unto all."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,12,6,Alma 12:6,Alma 12:6,"And behold I say unto you all that this was a snare of the adversary, which he has laid to catch this people, that he might bring you into subjection unto him, that he might encircle you about with his chains, that he might chain you down to everlasting destruction, according to the power of his captivity."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,12,7,Alma 12:7,Alma 12:7,"Now when Alma had spoken these words, Zeezrom began to tremble more exceedingly, for he was convinced more and more of the power of God; and he was also convinced that Alma and Amulek had a knowledge of him, for he was convinced that they knew the thoughts and intents of his heart; for power was given unto them that they might know of these things according to the spirit of prophecy."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,12,8,Alma 12:8,Alma 12:8,"And Zeezrom began to inquire of them diligently, that he might know more concerning the kingdom of God. And he said unto Alma: What does this mean which Amulek hath spoken concerning the resurrection of the dead, that all shall rise from the dead, both the just and the unjust, and are brought to stand before God to be judged according to their works?"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,12,9,Alma 12:9,Alma 12:9,"And now Alma began to expound these things unto him, saying: It is given unto many to know the mysteries of God; nevertheless they are laid under a strict command that they shall not impart only according to the portion of his word which he doth grant unto the children of men, according to the heed and diligence which they give unto him."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,12,10,Alma 12:10,Alma 12:10,"And therefore, he that will harden his heart, the same receiveth the lesser portion of the word; and he that will not harden his heart, to him is given the greater portion of the word, until it is given unto him to know the mysteries of God until he know them in full."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,12,11,Alma 12:11,Alma 12:11,"And they that will harden their hearts, to them is given the lesser portion of the word until they know nothing concerning his mysteries; and then they are taken captive by the devil, and led by his will down to destruction. Now this is what is meant by the chains of hell."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,12,12,Alma 12:12,Alma 12:12,"And Amulek hath spoken plainly concerning death, and being raised from this mortality to a state of immortality, and being brought before the bar of God, to be judged according to our works."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,12,13,Alma 12:13,Alma 12:13,"Then if our hearts have been hardened, yea, if we have hardened our hearts against the word, insomuch that it has not been found in us, then will our state be awful, for then we shall be condemned."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,12,14,Alma 12:14,Alma 12:14,"For our words will condemn us, yea, all our works will condemn us; we shall not be found spotless; and our thoughts will also condemn us; and in this awful state we shall not dare to look up to our God; and we would fain be glad if we could command the rocks and the mountains to fall upon us to hide us from his presence."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,12,15,Alma 12:15,Alma 12:15,"But this cannot be; we must come forth and stand before him in his glory, and in his power, and in his might, majesty, and dominion, and acknowledge to our everlasting shame that all his judgments are just; that he is just in all his works, and that he is merciful unto the children of men, and that he has all power to save every man that believeth on his name and bringeth forth fruit meet for repentance."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,12,16,Alma 12:16,Alma 12:16,"And now behold, I say unto you then cometh a death, even a second death, which is a spiritual death; then is a time that whosoever dieth in his sins, as to a temporal death, shall also die a spiritual death; yea, he shall die as to things pertaining unto righteousness."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,12,17,Alma 12:17,Alma 12:17,"Then is the time when their torments shall be as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever; and then is the time that they shall be chained down to an everlasting destruction, according to the power and captivity of Satan, he having subjected them according to his will."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,12,18,Alma 12:18,Alma 12:18,"Then, I say unto you, they shall be as though there had been no redemption made; for they cannot be redeemed according to God's justice; and they cannot die, seeing there is no more corruption."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,12,19,Alma 12:19,Alma 12:19,"Now it came to pass that when Alma had made an end of speaking these words, the people began to be more astonished;"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,12,20,Alma 12:20,Alma 12:20,"But there was one Antionah, who was a chief ruler among them, came forth and said unto him: What is this that thou hast said, that man should rise from the dead and be changed from this mortal to an immortal state that the soul can never die?"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,12,21,Alma 12:21,Alma 12:21,"What does the scripture mean, which saith that God placed cherubim and a flaming sword on the east of the garden of Eden, lest our first parents should enter and partake of the fruit of the tree of life, and live forever? And thus we see that there was no possible chance that they should live forever."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,12,22,Alma 12:22,Alma 12:22,"Now Alma said unto him: This is the thing which I was about to explain. Now we see that Adam did fall by the partaking of the forbidden fruit, according to the word of God; and thus we see, that by his fall, all mankind became a lost and fallen people."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,12,23,Alma 12:23,Alma 12:23,"And now behold, I say unto you that if it had been possible for Adam to have partaken of the fruit of the tree of life at that time, there would have been no death, and the word would have been void, making God a liar, for he said: If thou eat thou shalt surely die."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,12,24,Alma 12:24,Alma 12:24,"And we see that death comes upon mankind, yea, the death which has been spoken of by Amulek, which is the temporal death; nevertheless there was a space granted unto man in which he might repent; therefore this life became a probationary state; a time to prepare to meet God; a time to prepare for that endless state which has been spoken of by us, which is after the resurrection of the dead."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,12,25,Alma 12:25,Alma 12:25,"Now, if it had not been for the plan of redemption, which was laid from the foundation of the world, there could have been no resurrection of the dead; but there was a plan of redemption laid, which shall bring to pass the resurrection of the dead, of which has been spoken."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,12,26,Alma 12:26,Alma 12:26,"And now behold, if it were possible that our first parents could have gone forth and partaken of the tree of life they would have been forever miserable, having no preparatory state; and thus the plan of redemption would have been frustrated, and the word of God would have been void, taking none effect."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,12,27,Alma 12:27,Alma 12:27,"But behold, it was not so; but it was appointed unto men that they must die; and after death, they must come to judgment, even that same judgment of which we have spoken, which is the end."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,12,28,Alma 12:28,Alma 12:28,"And after God had appointed that these things should come unto man, behold, then he saw that it was expedient that man should know concerning the things whereof he had appointed unto them;"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,12,29,Alma 12:29,Alma 12:29,"Therefore he sent angels to converse with them, who caused men to behold of his glory."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,12,30,Alma 12:30,Alma 12:30,"And they began from that time forth to call on his name; therefore God conversed with men, and made known unto them the plan of redemption, which had been prepared from the foundation of the world; and this he made known unto them according to their faith and repentance and their holy works."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,12,31,Alma 12:31,Alma 12:31,"Wherefore, he gave commandments unto men, they having first transgressed the first commandments as to things which were temporal, and becoming as Gods, knowing good from evil, placing themselves in a state to act, or being placed in a state to act according to their wills and pleasures, whether to do evil or to do good--"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,12,32,Alma 12:32,Alma 12:32,"Therefore God gave unto them commandments, after having made known unto them the plan of redemption, that they should not do evil, the penalty thereof being a second death, which was an everlasting death as to things pertaining unto righteousness; for on such the plan of redemption could have no power, for the works of justice could not be destroyed, according to the supreme goodness of God."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,12,33,Alma 12:33,Alma 12:33,"But God did call on men, in the name of his Son, (this being the plan of redemption which was laid) saying: If ye will repent and harden not your hearts, then will I have mercy upon you, through mine Only Begotten Son;"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,12,34,Alma 12:34,Alma 12:34,"Therefore, whosoever repenteth, and hardeneth not his heart, he shall have claim on mercy through mine Only Begotten Son, unto a remission of his sins; and these shall enter into my rest."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,12,35,Alma 12:35,Alma 12:35,"And whosoever will harden his heart and will do iniquity, behold, I swear in my wrath that he shall not enter into my rest."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,12,36,Alma 12:36,Alma 12:36,"And now, my brethren, behold I say unto you, that if ye will harden your hearts ye shall not enter into the rest of the Lord; therefore your iniquity provoketh him that he sendeth down his wrath upon you as in the first provocation, yea, according to his word in the last provocation as well as the first, to the everlasting destruction of your souls; therefore, according to his word, unto the last death, as well as the first."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,12,37,Alma 12:37,Alma 12:37,"And now, my brethren, seeing we know these things, and they are true, let us repent, and harden not our hearts, that we provoke not the Lord our God to pull down his wrath upon us in these his second commandments which he has given unto us; but let us enter into the rest of God, which is prepared according to his word."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,13,1,Alma 13:1,Alma 13:1,"And again, my brethren, I would cite your minds forward to the time when the Lord God gave these commandments unto his children; and I would that ye should remember that the Lord God ordained priests, after his holy order, which was after the order of his Son, to teach these things unto the people."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,13,2,Alma 13:2,Alma 13:2,"And those priests were ordained after the order of his Son, in a manner that thereby the people might know in what manner to look forward to his Son for redemption."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,13,3,Alma 13:3,Alma 13:3,"And this is the manner after which they were ordained--being called and prepared from the foundation of the world according to the foreknowledge of God, on account of their exceeding faith and good works; in the first place being left to choose good or evil; therefore they having chosen good, and exercising exceedingly great faith, are called with a holy calling, yea, with that holy calling which was prepared with, and according to, a preparatory redemption for such."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,13,4,Alma 13:4,Alma 13:4,"And thus they have been called to this holy calling on account of their faith, while others would reject the Spirit of God on account of the hardness of their hearts and blindness of their minds, while, if it had not been for this they might have had as great privilege as their brethren."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,13,5,Alma 13:5,Alma 13:5,"Or in fine, in the first place they were on the same standing with their brethren; thus this holy calling being prepared from the foundation of the world for such as would not harden their hearts, being in and through the atonement of the Only Begotten Son, who was prepared--"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,13,6,Alma 13:6,Alma 13:6,"And thus being called by this holy calling, and ordained unto the high priesthood of the holy order of God, to teach his commandments unto the children of men, that they also might enter into his rest--"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,13,7,Alma 13:7,Alma 13:7,"This high priesthood being after the order of his Son, which order was from the foundation of the world; or in other words, being without beginning of days or end of years, being prepared from eternity to all eternity, according to his foreknowledge of all things--"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,13,8,Alma 13:8,Alma 13:8,"Now they were ordained after this manner--being called with a holy calling, and ordained with a holy ordinance, and taking upon them the high priesthood of the holy order, which calling, and ordinance, and high priesthood, is without beginning or end--"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,13,9,Alma 13:9,Alma 13:9,"Thus they become high priests forever, after the order of the Son, the Only Begotten of the Father, who is without beginning of days or end of years, who is full of grace, equity, and truth. And thus it is. Amen."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,13,10,Alma 13:10,Alma 13:10,"Now, as I said concerning the holy order, or this high priesthood, there were many who were ordained and became high priests of God; and it was on account of their exceeding faith and repentance, and their righteousness before God, they choosing to repent and work righteousness rather than to perish;"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,13,11,Alma 13:11,Alma 13:11,"Therefore they were called after this holy order, and were sanctified, and their garments were washed white through the blood of the Lamb."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,13,12,Alma 13:12,Alma 13:12,"Now they, after being sanctified by the Holy Ghost, having their garments made white, being pure and spotless before God, could not look upon sin save it were with abhorrence; and there were many, exceedingly great many, who were made pure and entered into the rest of the Lord their God."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,13,13,Alma 13:13,Alma 13:13,"And now, my brethren, I would that ye should humble yourselves before God, and bring forth fruit meet for repentance, that ye may also enter into that rest."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,13,14,Alma 13:14,Alma 13:14,"Yea, humble yourselves even as the people in the days of Melchizedek, who was also a high priest after this same order which I have spoken, who also took upon him the high priesthood forever."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,13,15,Alma 13:15,Alma 13:15,"And it was this same Melchizedek to whom Abraham paid tithes; yea, even our father Abraham paid tithes of one-tenth part of all he possessed."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,13,16,Alma 13:16,Alma 13:16,"Now these ordinances were given after this manner, that thereby the people might look forward on the Son of God, it being a type of his order, or it being his order, and this that they might look forward to him for a remission of their sins, that they might enter into the rest of the Lord."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,13,17,Alma 13:17,Alma 13:17,"Now this Melchizedek was a king over the land of Salem; and his people had waxed strong in iniquity and abomination; yea, they had all gone astray; they were full of all manner of wickedness;"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,13,18,Alma 13:18,Alma 13:18,"But Melchizedek having exercised mighty faith, and received the office of the high priesthood according to the holy order of God, did preach repentance unto his people. And behold, they did repent; and Melchizedek did establish peace in the land in his days; therefore he was called the prince of peace, for he was the king of Salem; and he did reign under his father."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,13,19,Alma 13:19,Alma 13:19,"Now, there were many before him, and also there were many afterwards, but none were greater; therefore, of him they have more particularly made mention."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,17,12,Alma 17:12,Alma 17:12,"And it came to pass that the hearts of the sons of Mosiah, and also those who were with them, took courage to go forth unto the Lamanites to declare unto them the word of God."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,17,13,Alma 17:13,Alma 17:13,"And it came to pass when they had arrived in the borders of the land of the Lamanites, that they separated themselves and departed one from another, trusting in the Lord that they should meet again at the close of their harvest; for they supposed that great was the work which they had undertaken."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,17,14,Alma 17:14,Alma 17:14,"And assuredly it was great, for they had undertaken to preach the word of God to a wild and a hardened and a ferocious people; a people who delighted in murdering the Nephites, and robbing and plundering them; and their hearts were set upon riches, or upon gold and silver, and precious stones; yet they sought to obtain these things by murdering and plundering, that they might not labor for them with their own hands."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,17,15,Alma 17:15,Alma 17:15,"Thus they were a very indolent people, many of whom did worship idols, and the curse of God had fallen upon them because of the traditions of their fathers; notwithstanding the promises of the Lord were extended unto them on the conditions of repentance."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,17,16,Alma 17:16,Alma 17:16,"Therefore, this was the cause for which the sons of Mosiah had undertaken the work, that perhaps they might bring them unto repentance; that perhaps they might bring them to know of the plan of redemption."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,17,17,Alma 17:17,Alma 17:17,"Therefore they separated themselves one from another, and went forth among them, every man alone, according to the word and power of God which was given unto him."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,17,18,Alma 17:18,Alma 17:18,"Now Ammon being the chief among them, or rather he did administer unto them, and he departed from them, after having blessed them according to their several stations, having imparted the word of God unto them, or administered unto them before his departure; and thus they took their several journeys throughout the land."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,17,19,Alma 17:19,Alma 17:19,"And Ammon went to the land of Ishmael, the land being called after the sons of Ishmael, who also became Lamanites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,17,20,Alma 17:20,Alma 17:20,"And as Ammon entered the land of Ishmael, the Lamanites took him and bound him, as was their custom to bind all the Nephites who fell into their hands, and carry them before the king; and thus it was left to the pleasure of the king to slay them, or to retain them in captivity, or to cast them into prison, or to cast them out of his land, according to his will and pleasure."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,17,21,Alma 17:21,Alma 17:21,And thus Ammon was carried before the king who was over the land of Ishmael; and his name was Lamoni; and he was a descendant of Ishmael.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,17,22,Alma 17:22,Alma 17:22,"And the king inquired of Ammon if it were his desire to dwell in the land among the Lamanites, or among his people."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,17,23,Alma 17:23,Alma 17:23,"And Ammon said unto him: Yea, I desire to dwell among this people for a time; yea, and perhaps until the day I die."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,17,24,Alma 17:24,Alma 17:24,"And it came to pass that king Lamoni was much pleased with Ammon, and caused that his bands should be loosed; and he would that Ammon should take one of his daughters to wife."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,17,25,Alma 17:25,Alma 17:25,"But Ammon said unto him: Nay, but I will be thy servant. Therefore Ammon became a servant to king Lamoni. And it came to pass that he was set among other servants to watch the flocks of Lamoni, according to the custom of the Lamanites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,17,26,Alma 17:26,Alma 17:26,"And after he had been in the service of the king three days, as he was with the Lamanitish servants going forth with their flocks to the place of water, which was called the water of Sebus, and all the Lamanites drive their flocks hither, that they may have water--"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,17,27,Alma 17:27,Alma 17:27,"Therefore, as Ammon and the servants of the king were driving forth their flocks to this place of water, behold, a certain number of the Lamanites, who had been with their flocks to water, stood and scattered the flocks of Ammon and the servants of the king, and they scattered them insomuch that they fled many ways."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,17,28,Alma 17:28,Alma 17:28,"Now the servants of the king began to murmur, saying: Now the king will slay us, as he has our brethren because their flocks were scattered by the wickedness of these men. And they began to weep exceedingly, saying: Behold, our flocks are scattered already."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,17,29,Alma 17:29,Alma 17:29,"Now they wept because of the fear of being slain. Now when Ammon saw this his heart was swollen within him with joy; for, said he, I will show forth my power unto these my fellow-servants, or the power which is in me, in restoring these flocks unto the king, that I may win the hearts of these my fellow-servants, that I may lead them to believe in my words."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,17,30,Alma 17:30,Alma 17:30,"And now, these were the thoughts of Ammon, when he saw the afflictions of those whom he termed to be his brethren."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,17,31,Alma 17:31,Alma 17:31,"And it came to pass that he flattered them by his words, saying: My brethren, be of good cheer and let us go in search of the flocks, and we will gather them together and bring them back unto the place of water; and thus we will preserve the flocks unto the king and he will not slay us."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,17,32,Alma 17:32,Alma 17:32,"And it came to pass that they went in search of the flocks, and they did follow Ammon, and they rushed forth with much swiftness and did head the flocks of the king, and did gather them together again to the place of water."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,17,33,Alma 17:33,Alma 17:33,And those men again stood to scatter their flocks; but Ammon said unto his brethren: Encircle the flocks round about that they flee not; and I go and contend with these men who do scatter our flocks.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,17,34,Alma 17:34,Alma 17:34,"Therefore, they did as Ammon commanded them, and he went forth and stood to contend with those who stood by the waters of Sebus; and they were in number not a few."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,17,35,Alma 17:35,Alma 17:35,"Therefore they did not fear Ammon, for they supposed that one of their men could slay him according to their pleasure, for they knew not that the Lord had promised Mosiah that he would deliver his sons out of their hands; neither did they know anything concerning the Lord; therefore they delighted in the destruction of their brethren; and for this cause they stood to scatter the flocks of the king."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,17,36,Alma 17:36,Alma 17:36,"But Ammon stood forth and began to cast stones at them with his sling; yea, with mighty power he did sling stones amongst them; and thus he slew a certain number of them insomuch that they began to be astonished at his power; nevertheless they were angry because of the slain of their brethren, and they were determined that he should fall; therefore, seeing that they could not hit him with their stones, they came forth with clubs to slay him."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,17,37,Alma 17:37,Alma 17:37,"But behold, every man that lifted his club to smite Ammon, he smote off their arms with his sword; for he did withstand their blows by smiting their arms with the edge of his sword, insomuch that they began to be astonished, and began to flee before him; yea, and they were not few in number; and he caused them to flee by the strength of his arm."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,17,38,Alma 17:38,Alma 17:38,"Now six of them had fallen by the sling, but he slew none save it were their leader with his sword; and he smote off as many of their arms as were lifted against him, and they were not a few."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,17,39,Alma 17:39,Alma 17:39,"And when he had driven them afar off, he returned and they watered their flocks and returned them to the pasture of the king, and then went in unto the king, bearing the arms which had been smitten off by the sword of Ammon, of those who sought to slay him; and they were carried in unto the king for a testimony of the things which they had done."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,18,1,Alma 18:1,Alma 18:1,And it came to pass that king Lamoni caused that his servants should stand forth and testify to all the things which they had seen concerning the matter.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,18,2,Alma 18:2,Alma 18:2,"And when they had all testified to the things which they had seen, and he had learned of the faithfulness of Ammon in preserving his flocks, and also of his great power in contending against those who sought to slay him, he was astonished exceedingly, and said: Surely, this is more than a man. Behold, is not this the Great Spirit who doth send such great punishments upon this people, because of their murders?"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,18,3,Alma 18:3,Alma 18:3,"And they answered the king, and said: Whether he be the Great Spirit or a man, we know not; but this much we do know, that he cannot be slain by the enemies of the king; neither can they scatter the king's flocks when he is with us, because of his expertness and great strength; therefore, we know that he is a friend to the king. And now, O king, we do not believe that a man has such great power, for we know he cannot be slain."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,18,4,Alma 18:4,Alma 18:4,"And now, when the king heard these words, he said unto them: Now I know that it is the Great Spirit; and he has come down at this time to preserve your lives, that I might not slay you as I did your brethren. Now this is the Great Spirit of whom our fathers have spoken."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,18,5,Alma 18:5,Alma 18:5,"Now this was the tradition of Lamoni, which he had received from his father, that there was a Great Spirit. Notwithstanding they believed in a Great Spirit they supposed that whatsoever they did was right; nevertheless, Lamoni began to fear exceedingly, with fear lest he had done wrong in slaying his servants;"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,18,6,Alma 18:6,Alma 18:6,"For he had slain many of them because their brethren had scattered their flocks at the place of water; and thus, because they had had their flocks scattered they were slain."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,18,7,Alma 18:7,Alma 18:7,"Now it was the practice of these Lamanites to stand by the waters of Sebus to scatter the flocks of the people, that thereby they might drive away many that were scattered unto their own land, it being a practice of plunder among them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,18,8,Alma 18:8,Alma 18:8,"And it came to pass that king Lamoni inquired of his servants, saying: Where is this man that has such great power?"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,18,9,Alma 18:9,Alma 18:9,"And they said unto him: Behold, he is feeding thy horses. Now the king had commanded his servants, previous to the time of the watering of their flocks, that they should prepare his horses and chariots, and conduct him forth to the land of Nephi; for there had been a great feast appointed at the land of Nephi, by the father of Lamoni, who was king over all the land."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,18,10,Alma 18:10,Alma 18:10,"Now when king Lamoni heard that Ammon was preparing his horses and his chariots he was more astonished, because of the faithfulness of Ammon, saying: Surely there has not been any servant among all my servants that has been so faithful as this man; for even he doth remember all my commandments to execute them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,18,11,Alma 18:11,Alma 18:11,"Now I surely know that this is the Great Spirit, and I would desire him that he come in unto me, but I durst not."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,18,12,Alma 18:12,Alma 18:12,"And it came to pass that when Ammon had made ready the horses and the chariots for the king and his servants, he went in unto the king, and he saw that the countenance of the king was changed; therefore he was about to return out of his presence."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,18,13,Alma 18:13,Alma 18:13,"And one of the king's servants said unto him, Rabbanah, which is, being interpreted, powerful or great king, considering their kings to be powerful; and thus he said unto him: Rabbanah, the king desireth thee to stay."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,18,14,Alma 18:14,Alma 18:14,"Therefore Ammon turned himself unto the king, and said unto him: What wilt thou that I should do for thee, O king? And the king answered him not for the space of an hour, according to their time, for he knew not what he should say unto him."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,18,15,Alma 18:15,Alma 18:15,And it came to pass that Ammon said unto him again: What desirest thou of me? But the king answered him not.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,18,16,Alma 18:16,Alma 18:16,"And it came to pass that Ammon, being filled with the Spirit of God, therefore he perceived the thoughts of the king. And he said unto him: Is it because thou hast heard that I defended thy servants and thy flocks, and slew seven of their brethren with the sling and with the sword, and smote off the arms of others, in order to defend thy flocks and thy servants; behold, is it this that causeth thy marvelings?"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,18,17,Alma 18:17,Alma 18:17,"I say unto you, what is it, that thy marvelings are so great? Behold, I am a man, and am thy servant; therefore, whatsoever thou desirest which is right, that will I do."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,18,18,Alma 18:18,Alma 18:18,"Now when the king had heard these words, he marveled again, for he beheld that Ammon could discern his thoughts; but notwithstanding this, king Lamoni did open his mouth, and said unto him: Who art thou? Art thou that Great Spirit, who knows all things?"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,18,19,Alma 18:19,Alma 18:19,Ammon answered and said unto him: I am not.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,18,20,Alma 18:20,Alma 18:20,"And the king said: How knowest thou the thoughts of my heart? Thou mayest speak boldly, and tell me concerning these things; and also tell me by what power ye slew and smote off the arms of my brethren that scattered my flocks--"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,18,21,Alma 18:21,Alma 18:21,"And now, if thou wilt tell me concerning these things, whatsoever thou desirest I will give unto thee; and if it were needed, I would guard thee with my armies; but I know that thou art more powerful than all they; nevertheless, whatsoever thou desirest of me I will grant it unto thee."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,18,22,Alma 18:22,Alma 18:22,"Now Ammon being wise, yet harmless, he said unto Lamoni: Wilt thou hearken unto my words, if I tell thee by what power I do these things? And this is the thing that I desire of thee."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,18,23,Alma 18:23,Alma 18:23,"And the king answered him, and said: Yea, I will believe all thy words. And thus he was caught with guile."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,19,6,Alma 19:6,Alma 19:6,"Now, this was what Ammon desired, for he knew that king Lamoni was under the power of God; he knew that the dark veil of unbelief was being cast away from his mind, and the light which did light up his mind, which was the light of the glory of God, which was a marvelous light of his goodness--yea, this light had infused such joy into his soul, the cloud of darkness having been dispelled, and that the light of everlasting life was lit up in his soul, yea, he knew that this had overcome his natural frame, and he was carried away in God--"

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,19,17,Alma 19:17,Alma 19:17,"Thus, having been converted to the Lord, and never having made it known, therefore, when she saw that all the servants of Lamoni had fallen to the earth, and also her mistress, the queen, and the king, and Ammon lay prostrate upon the earth, she knew that it was the power of God; and supposing that this opportunity, by making known unto the people what had happened among them, that by beholding this scene it would cause them to believe in the power of God, therefore she ran forth from house to house, making it known unto the people."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,19,18,Alma 19:18,Alma 19:18,"And they began to assemble themselves together unto the house of the king.

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,19,23,Alma 19:23,Alma 19:23,"Now we see that Ammon could not be slain, for the Lord had said unto Mosiah, his father: I will spare him, and it shall be unto him according to thy faith--therefore, Mosiah trusted him unto the Lord."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,19,24,Alma 19:24,Alma 19:24,"And it came to pass that when the multitude beheld that the man had fallen dead, who lifted the sword to slay Ammon, fear came upon them all, and they durst not put forth their hands to touch him or any of those who had fallen; and they began to marvel again among themselves what could be the cause of this great power, or what all these things could mean."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,19,25,Alma 19:25,Alma 19:25,"And it came to pass that there were many among them who said that Ammon was the Great Spirit, and others said he was sent by the Great Spirit;"

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,19,27,Alma 19:27,Alma 19:27,"And there were some who said that Ammon was sent by the Great Spirit to afflict them because of their iniquities; and that it was the Great Spirit that had always attended the Nephites, who had ever delivered them out of their hands; and they said that it was this Great Spirit who had destroyed so many of their brethren, the Lamanites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,19,28,Alma 19:28,Alma 19:28,"And thus the contention began to be exceedingly sharp among them. And while they were thus contending, the woman servant who had caused the multitude to be gathered together came, and when she saw the contention which was among the multitude she was exceedingly sorrowful, even unto tears."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,19,29,Alma 19:29,Alma 19:29,"And it came to pass that she went and took the queen by the hand, that perhaps she might raise her from the ground; and as soon as she touched her hand she arose and stood upon her feet, and cried with a loud voice, saying: O blessed Jesus, who has saved me from an awful hell! O blessed God, have mercy on this people!"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,19,30,Alma 19:30,Alma 19:30,"And when she had said this, she clasped her hands, being filled with joy, speaking many words which were not understood; and when she had done this, she took the king, Lamoni, by the hand, and behold he arose and stood upon his feet."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,19,32,Alma 19:32,Alma 19:32,But there were many among them who would not hear his words; therefore they went their way.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,19,33,Alma 19:33,Alma 19:33,"And it came to pass that when Ammon arose he also administered unto them, and also did all the servants of Lamoni; and they did all declare unto the people the selfsame thing--that their hearts had been changed; that they had no more desire to do evil."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,19,34,Alma 19:34,Alma 19:34,"And behold, many did declare unto the people that they had seen angels and had conversed with them; and thus they had told them things of God, and of his righteousness."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,19,36,Alma 19:36,Alma 19:36,And thus the work of the Lord did commence among the Lamanites; thus the Lord did begin to pour out his Spirit upon them; and we see that his arm is extended to all people who will repent and believe on his name.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,20,1,Alma 20:1,Alma 20:1,"And it came to pass that when they had established a church in that land, that king Lamoni desired that Ammon should go with him to the land of Nephi, that he might show him unto his father."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,20,2,Alma 20:2,Alma 20:2,"And the voice of the Lord came to Ammon, saying: Thou shalt not go up to the land of Nephi, for behold, the king will seek thy life; but thou shalt go to the land of Middoni; for behold, thy brother Aaron, and also Muloki and Ammah are in prison."

But behold, I will go with thee to the land of Middoni; for the king of the land of Middoni, whose name is Antiomno, is a friend unto me; therefore I go to the land of Middoni, that I may flatter the king of the land, and he will cast thy brethren out of prison. Now Lamoni said unto him: Who told thee that thy brethren were in prison?"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,20,5,Alma 20:5,Alma 20:5,"And Ammon said unto him: No one hath told me, save it be God; and he said unto me--Go and deliver thy brethren, for they are in prison in the land of Middoni."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,20,12,Alma 20:12,Alma 20:12,"And he also told him all the cause of his tarrying in his own kingdom, that he did not go unto his father to the feast which he had prepared."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,20,13,Alma 20:13,Alma 20:13,"And now when Lamoni had rehearsed unto him all these things, behold, to his astonishment, his father was angry with him, and said: Lamoni, thou art going to deliver these Nephites, who are sons of a liar. Behold, he robbed our fathers; and now his children are also come amongst us that they may, by their cunning and their lyings, deceive us, that they again may rob us of our property."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,20,14,Alma 20:14,Alma 20:14,"Now the father of Lamoni commanded him that he should slay Ammon with the sword. And he also commanded him that he should not go to the land of Middoni, but that he should return with him to the land of Ishmael."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,20,18,Alma 20:18,Alma 20:18,"And again, it is expedient that thou shouldst forbear; for if thou shouldst slay thy son, he being an innocent man, his blood would cry from the ground to the Lord his God, for vengeance to come upon thee; and perhaps thou wouldst lose thy soul."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,20,19,Alma 20:19,Alma 20:19,"Now when Ammon had said these words unto him, he answered him, saying: I know that if I should slay my son, that I should shed innocent blood; for it is thou that hast sought to destroy him."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,20,30,Alma 20:30,Alma 20:30,"And, as it happened, it was their lot to have fallen into the hands of a more hardened and a more stiffnecked people; therefore they would not hearken unto their words, and they had cast them out, and had smitten them, and had driven them from house to house, and from place to place, even until they had arrived in the land of Middoni; and there they were taken and cast into prison, and bound with strong cords, and kept in prison for many days, and were delivered by Lamoni and Ammon."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,21,1,Alma 21:1,Alma 21:1,"Now when Ammon and his brethren separated themselves in the borders of the land of the Lamanites, behold Aaron took his journey towards the land which was called by the Lamanites, Jerusalem, calling it after the land of their fathers' nativity; and it was away joining the borders of Mormon."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,21,5,Alma 21:5,Alma 21:5,"Therefore, as Aaron entered into one of their synagogues to preach unto the people, and as he was speaking unto them, behold there arose an Amalekite and began to contend with him, saying: What is that thou hast testified?

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,21,9,Alma 21:9,Alma 21:9,"Now Aaron began to open the scriptures unto them concerning the coming of Christ, and also concerning the resurrection of the dead, and that there could be no redemption for mankind save it were through the death and sufferings of Christ, and the atonement of his blood."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,21,12,Alma 21:12,Alma 21:12,"And it came to pass that they saw that the people would harden their hearts, therefore they departed and came over into the land of Middoni. And they did preach the word unto many, and few believed on the words which they taught."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,21,13,Alma 21:13,Alma 21:13,"Nevertheless, Aaron and a certain number of his brethren were taken and cast into prison, and the remainder of them fled out of the land of Middoni unto the regions round about."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,22,1,Alma 22:1,Alma 22:1,"Now, as Ammon was thus teaching the people of Lamoni continually, we will return to the account of Aaron and his brethren; for after he departed from the land of Middoni he was led by the Spirit to the land of Nephi, even to the house of the king which was over all the land save it were the land of Ishmael; and he was the father of Lamoni."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,22,2,Alma 22:2,Alma 22:2,"And it came to pass that he went in unto him into the king's palace, with his brethren, and bowed himself before the king, and said unto him: Behold, O king, we are the brethren of Ammon, whom thou hast delivered out of prison."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,22,27,Alma 22:27,Alma 22:27,"And it came to pass that the king sent a proclamation throughout all the land, amongst all his people who were in all his land, who were in all the regions round about, which was bordering even to the sea, on the east and on the west, and which was divided from the land of Zarahemla by a narrow strip of wilderness, which ran from the sea east even to the sea west, and round about on the borders of the seashore, and the borders of the wilderness which was on the north by the land of Zarahemla, through the borders of Manti, by the head of the river Sidon, running from the east towards the west--and thus were the Lamanites and the Nephites divided."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,22,28,Alma 22:28,Alma 22:28,"Now, the more idle part of the Lamanites lived in the wilderness, and dwelt in tents; and they were spread through the wilderness on the west, in the land of Nephi; yea, and also on the west of the land of Zarahemla, in the borders by the seashore, and on the west in the land of Nephi, in the place of their fathers' first inheritance, and thus bordering along by the seashore."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,22,29,Alma 22:29,Alma 22:29,"And also there were many Lamanites on the east by the seashore, whither the Nephites had driven them. And thus the Nephites were nearly surrounded by the Lamanites; nevertheless the Nephites had taken possession of all the northern parts of the land bordering on the wilderness, at the head of the river Sidon, from the east to the west, round about on the wilderness side; on the north, even until they came to the land which they called Bountiful."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,22,30,Alma 22:30,Alma 22:30,"And it bordered upon the land which they called Desolation, it being so far northward that it came into the land which had been peopled and been destroyed, of whose bones we have spoken, which was discovered by the people of Zarahemla, it being the place of their first landing."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,22,31,Alma 22:31,Alma 22:31,"And they came from there up into the south wilderness. Thus the land on the northward was called Desolation, and the land on the southward was called Bountiful, it being the wilderness which is filled with all manner of wild animals of every kind, a part of which had come from the land northward for food."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,22,32,Alma 22:32,Alma 22:32,"And now, it was only the distance of a day and a half's journey for a Nephite, on the line Bountiful and the land Desolation, from the east to the west sea; and thus the land of Nephi and the land of Zarahemla were nearly surrounded by water, there being a small neck of land between the land northward and the land southward."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,22,33,Alma 22:33,Alma 22:33,"And it came to pass that the Nephites had inhabited the land Bountiful, even from the east unto the west sea, and thus the Nephites in their wisdom, with their guards and their armies, had hemmed in the Lamanites on the south, that thereby they should have no more possession on the north, that they might not overrun the land northward."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,22,34,Alma 22:34,Alma 22:34,"Therefore the Lamanites could have no more possessions only in the land of Nephi, and the wilderness round about. Now this was wisdom in the Nephites--as the Lamanites were an enemy to them, they would not suffer their afflictions on every hand, and also that they might have a country whither they might flee, according to their desires."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,22,35,Alma 22:35,Alma 22:35,"And now I, after having said this, return again to the account of Ammon and Aaron, Omner and Himni, and their brethren."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,23,1,Alma 23:1,Alma 23:1,"Behold, now it came to pass that the king of the Lamanites sent a proclamation among all his people, that they should not lay their hands on Ammon, or Aaron, or Omner, or Himni, nor either of their brethren who should go forth preaching the word of God, in whatsoever place they should be, in any part of their land."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,23,2,Alma 23:2,Alma 23:2,"Yea, he sent a decree among them, that they should not lay their hands on them to bind them, or to cast them into prison; neither should they spit upon them, nor smite them, nor cast them out of their synagogues, nor scourge them; neither should they cast stones at them, but that they should have free access to their houses, and also their temples, and their sanctuaries."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,23,3,Alma 23:3,Alma 23:3,"And thus they might go forth and preach the word according to their desires, for the king had been converted unto the Lord, and all his household; therefore he sent his proclamation throughout the land unto his people, that the word of God might have no obstruction, but that it might go forth throughout all the land, that his people might be convinced concerning the wicked traditions of their fathers, and that they might be convinced that they were all brethren, and that they ought not to murder, nor to plunder, nor to steal, nor to commit adultery, nor to commit any manner of wickedness."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,23,4,Alma 23:4,Alma 23:4,"And now it came to pass that when the king had sent forth this proclamation, that Aaron and his brethren went forth from city to city, and from one house of worship to another, establishing churches, and consecrating priests and teachers throughout the land among the Lamanites, to preach and to teach the word of God among them; and thus they began to have great success."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,23,5,Alma 23:5,Alma 23:5,"And thousands were brought to the knowledge of the Lord, yea, thousands were brought to believe in the traditions of the Nephites; and they were taught the records and prophecies which were handed down even to the present time."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,23,6,Alma 23:6,Alma 23:6,"And as sure as the Lord liveth, so sure as many as believed, or as many as were brought to the knowledge of the truth, through the preaching of Ammon and his brethren, according to the spirit of revelation and of prophecy, and the power of God working miracles in them--yea, I say unto you, as the Lord liveth, as many of the Lamanites as believed in their preaching, and were converted unto the Lord, never did fall away."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,23,7,Alma 23:7,Alma 23:7,"For they became a righteous people; they did lay down the weapons of their rebellion, that they did not fight against God any more, neither against any of their brethren."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,23,8,Alma 23:8,Alma 23:8,"Now, these are they who were converted unto the Lord:"

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,23,13,Alma 23:13,Alma 23:13,"And these are the names of the cities of the Lamanites which were converted unto the Lord; and these are they that laid down the weapons of their rebellion, yea, all their weapons of war; and they were all Lamanites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,23,14,Alma 23:14,Alma 23:14,"And the Amalekites were not converted, save only one; neither were any of the Amulonites; but they did harden their hearts, and also the hearts of the Lamanites in that part of the land wheresoever they dwelt, yea, and all their villages and all their cities."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,23,15,Alma 23:15,Alma 23:15,"Therefore, we have named all the cities of the Lamanites in which they did repent and come to the knowledge of the truth, and were converted."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,23,16,Alma 23:16,Alma 23:16,"And now it came to pass that the king and those who were converted were desirous that they might have a name, that thereby they might be distinguished from their brethren; therefore the king consulted with Aaron and many of their priests, concerning the name that they should take upon them, that they might be distinguished."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,23,17,Alma 23:17,Alma 23:17,And it came to pass that they called their names Anti-Nephi-Lehies; and they were called by this name and were no more called Lamanites.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,23,18,Alma 23:18,Alma 23:18,"And they began to be a very industrious people; yea, and they were friendly with the Nephites; therefore, they did open a correspondence with them, and the curse of God did no more follow them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,24,1,Alma 24:1,Alma 24:1,"And it came to pass that the Amalekites and the Amulonites and the Lamanites who were in the land of Amulon, and also in the land of Helam, and who were in the land of Jerusalem, and in fine, in all the land round about, who had not been converted and had not taken upon them the name of Anti-Nephi-Lehi, were stirred up by the Amalekites and by the Amulonites to anger against their brethren."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,24,2,Alma 24:2,Alma 24:2,"And their hatred became exceedingly sore against them, even insomuch that they began to rebel against their king, insomuch that they would not that he should be their king; therefore, they took up arms against the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,24,3,Alma 24:3,Alma 24:3,"Now the king conferred the kingdom upon his son, and he called his name Anti-Nephi-Lehi."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,24,4,Alma 24:4,Alma 24:4,And the king died in that selfsame year that the Lamanites began to make preparations for war against the people of God.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,24,5,Alma 24:5,Alma 24:5,"Now when Ammon and his brethren and all those who had come up with him saw the preparations of the Lamanites to destroy their brethren, they came forth to the land of Midian, and there Ammon met all his brethren; and from thence they came to the land of Ishmael that they might hold a council with Lamoni and also with his brother Anti-Nephi-Lehi, what they should do to defend themselves against the Lamanites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,24,6,Alma 24:6,Alma 24:6,"Now there was not one soul among all the people who had been converted unto the Lord that would take up arms against their brethren; nay, they would not even make any preparations for war; yea, and also their king commanded them that they should not."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,24,7,Alma 24:7,Alma 24:7,"Now, these are the words which he said unto the people concerning the matter: I thank my God, my beloved people, that our great God has in goodness sent these our brethren, the Nephites, unto us to preach unto us, and to convince us of the traditions of our wicked fathers."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,24,8,Alma 24:8,Alma 24:8,"And behold, I thank my great God that he has given us a portion of his Spirit to soften our hearts, that we have opened a correspondence with these brethren, the Nephites."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,24,11,Alma 24:11,Alma 24:11,"And now behold, my brethren, since it has been all that we could do, (as we were the most lost of all mankind) to repent of all our sins and the many murders which we have committed, and to get God to take them away from our hearts, for it was all we could do to repent sufficiently before God that he would take away our stain--"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,24,12,Alma 24:12,Alma 24:12,"Now, my best beloved brethren, since God hath taken away our stains, and our swords have become bright, then let us stain our swords no more with the blood of our brethren."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,24,13,Alma 24:13,Alma 24:13,"Behold, I say unto you, Nay, let us retain our swords that they be not stained with the blood of our brethren; for perhaps, if we should stain our swords again they can no more be washed bright through the blood of the Son of our great God, which shall be shed for the atonement of our sins."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,24,14,Alma 24:14,Alma 24:14,"And the great God has had mercy on us, and made these things known unto us that we might not perish; yea, and he has made these things known unto us beforehand, because he loveth our souls as well as he loveth our children; therefore, in his mercy he doth visit us by his angels, that the plan of salvation might be made known unto us as well as unto future generations."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,24,15,Alma 24:15,Alma 24:15,"Oh, how merciful is our God! And now behold, since it has been as much as we could do to get our stains taken away from us, and our swords are made bright, let us hide them away that they may be kept bright, as a testimony to our God at the last day, or at the day that we shall be brought to stand before him to be judged, that we have not stained our swords in the blood of our brethren since he imparted his word unto us and has made us clean thereby."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,24,16,Alma 24:16,Alma 24:16,"And now, my brethren, if our brethren seek to destroy us, behold, we will hide away our swords, yea, even we will bury them deep in the earth, that they may be kept bright, as a testimony that we have never used them, at the last day; and if our brethren destroy us, behold, we shall go to our God and shall be saved."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,24,17,Alma 24:17,Alma 24:17,"And now it came to pass that when the king had made an end of these sayings, and all the people were assembled together, they took their swords, and all the weapons which were used for the shedding of man's blood, and they did bury them up deep in the earth."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,24,18,Alma 24:18,Alma 24:18,"And this they did, it being in their view a testimony to God, and also to men, that they never would use weapons again for the shedding of man's blood; and this they did, vouching and covenanting with God, that rather than shed the blood of their brethren they would give up their own lives; and rather than take away from a brother they would give unto him; and rather than spend their days in idleness they would labor abundantly with their hands."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,24,19,Alma 24:19,Alma 24:19,"And thus we see that, when these Lamanites were brought to believe and to know the truth, they were firm, and would suffer even unto death rather than commit sin; and thus we see that they buried their weapons of peace, or they buried the weapons of war, for peace."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,24,20,Alma 24:20,Alma 24:20,"And it came to pass that their brethren, the Lamanites, made preparations for war, and came up to the land of Nephi for the purpose of destroying the king, and to place another in his stead, and also of destroying the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi out of the land."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,24,21,Alma 24:21,Alma 24:21,"Now when the people saw that they were coming against them they went out to meet them, and prostrated themselves before them to the earth, and began to call on the name of the Lord; and thus they were in this attitude when the Lamanites began to fall upon them, and began to slay them with the sword."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,24,22,Alma 24:22,Alma 24:22,"And thus without meeting any resistance, they did slay a thousand and five of them; and we know that they are blessed, for they have gone to dwell with their God."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,24,23,Alma 24:23,Alma 24:23,"Now when the Lamanites saw that their brethren would not flee from the sword, neither would they turn aside to the right hand or to the left, but that they would lie down and perish, and praised God even in the very act of perishing under the sword--"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,24,24,Alma 24:24,Alma 24:24,"Now when the Lamanites saw this they did forbear from slaying them; and there were many whose hearts had swollen in them for those of their brethren who had fallen under the sword, for they repented of the things which they had done."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,24,25,Alma 24:25,Alma 24:25,"And it came to pass that they threw down their weapons of war, and they would not take them again, for they were stung for the murders which they had committed; and they came down even as their brethren, relying upon the mercies of those whose arms were lifted to slay them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,24,26,Alma 24:26,Alma 24:26,"And it came to pass that the people of God were joined that day by more than the number who had been slain; and those who had been slain were righteous people, therefore we have no reason to doubt but what they were saved."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,24,27,Alma 24:27,Alma 24:27,And there was not a wicked man slain among them; but there were more than a thousand brought to the knowledge of the truth; thus we see that the Lord worketh in many ways to the salvation of his people.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,24,28,Alma 24:28,Alma 24:28,"Now the greatest number of those of the Lamanites who slew so many of their brethren were Amalekites and Amulonites, the greatest number of whom were after the order of the Nehors."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,24,29,Alma 24:29,Alma 24:29,"Now, among those who joined the people of the Lord, there were none who were Amalekites or Amulonites, or who were of the order of Nehor, but they were actual descendants of Laman and Lemuel."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,24,30,Alma 24:30,Alma 24:30,"And thus we can plainly discern, that after a people have been once enlightened by the Spirit of God, and have had great knowledge of things pertaining to righteousness, and then have fallen away into sin and transgression, they become more hardened, and thus their state becomes worse than though they had never known these things."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,25,1,Alma 25:1,Alma 25:1,"And behold, now it came to pass that those Lamanites were more angry because they had slain their brethren; therefore they swore vengeance upon the Nephites; and they did no more attempt to slay the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi at that time."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,25,2,Alma 25:2,Alma 25:2,"But they took their armies and went over into the borders of the land of Zarahemla, and fell upon the people who were in the land of Ammonihah and destroyed them."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,25,5,Alma 25:5,Alma 25:5,"And the remainder, having fled into the east wilderness, and having usurped the power and authority over the Lamanites, caused that many of the Lamanites should perish by fire because of their belief--"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,25,6,Alma 25:6,Alma 25:6,"For many of them, after having suffered much loss and so many afflictions, began to be stirred up in remembrance of the words which Aaron and his brethren had preached to them in their land; therefore they began to disbelieve the traditions of their fathers, and to believe in the Lord, and that he gave great power unto the Nephites; and thus there were many of them converted in the wilderness."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,25,7,Alma 25:7,Alma 25:7,"And it came to pass that those rulers who were the remnant of the children of Amulon caused that they should be put to death, yea, all those that believed in these things."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,25,8,Alma 25:8,Alma 25:8,Now this martyrdom caused that many of their brethren should be stirred up to anger; and there began to be contention in the wilderness; and the Lamanites began to hunt the seed of Amulon and his brethren and began to slay them; and they fled into the east wilderness.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,25,9,Alma 25:9,Alma 25:9,"And behold they are hunted at this day by the Lamanites. Thus the words of Abinadi were brought to pass, which he said concerning the seed of the priests who caused that he should suffer death by fire."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,25,10,Alma 25:10,Alma 25:10,For he said unto them: What ye shall do unto me shall be a type of things to come.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,25,11,Alma 25:11,Alma 25:11,"And now Abinadi was the first that suffered death by fire because of his belief in God; now this is what he meant, that many should suffer death by fire, according as he had suffered."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,25,12,Alma 25:12,Alma 25:12,"And he said unto the priests of Noah that their seed should cause many to be put to death, in the like manner as he was, and that they should be scattered abroad and slain, even as a sheep having no shepherd is driven and slain by wild beasts; and now behold, these words were verified, for they were driven by the Lamanites, and they were hunted, and they were smitten."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,25,13,Alma 25:13,Alma 25:13,"And it came to pass that when the Lamanites saw that they could not overpower the Nephites they returned again to their own land; and many of them came over to dwell in the land of Ishmael and the land of Nephi, and did join themselves to the people of God, who were the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,25,14,Alma 25:14,Alma 25:14,"And they did also bury their weapons of war, according as their brethren had, and they began to be a righteous people; and they did walk in the ways of the Lord, and did observe to keep his commandments and his statutes."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,25,15,Alma 25:15,Alma 25:15,"Yea, and they did keep the law of Moses; for it was expedient that they should keep the law of Moses as yet, for it was not all fulfilled. But notwithstanding the law of Moses, they did look forward to the coming of Christ, considering that the law of Moses was a type of his coming, and believing that they must keep those outward performances until the time that he should be revealed unto them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,25,16,Alma 25:16,Alma 25:16,"Now they did not suppose that salvation came by the law of Moses; but the law of Moses did serve to strengthen their faith in Christ; and thus they did retain a hope through faith, unto eternal salvation, relying upon the spirit of prophecy, which spake of those things to come."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,25,17,Alma 25:17,Alma 25:17,"And now behold, Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner, and Himni, and their brethren did rejoice exceedingly, for the success which they had had among the Lamanites, seeing that the Lord had granted unto them according to their prayers, and that he had also verified his word unto them in every particular."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,26,1,Alma 26:1,Alma 26:1,"And now, these are the words of Ammon to his brethren, which say thus: My brothers and my brethren, behold I say unto you, how great reason have we to rejoice; for could we have supposed when we started from the land of Zarahemla that God would have granted unto us such great blessings?"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,26,2,Alma 26:2,Alma 26:2,"And now, I ask, what great blessings has he bestowed upon us? Can ye tell?"

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,26,23,Alma 26:23,Alma 26:23,"Now do ye remember, my brethren, that we said unto our brethren in the land of Zarahemla, we go up to the land of Nephi, to preach unto our brethren, the Lamanites, and they laughed us to scorn?"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,26,24,Alma 26:24,Alma 26:24,"For they said unto us: Do ye suppose that ye can bring the Lamanites to the knowledge of the truth? Do ye suppose that ye can convince the Lamanites of the incorrectness of the traditions of their fathers, as stiffnecked a people as they are; whose hearts delight in the shedding of blood; whose days have been spent in the grossest iniquity; whose ways have been the ways of a transgressor from the beginning? Now my brethren, ye remember that this was their language."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,30,17,Alma 30:17,Alma 30:17,"And many more such things did he say unto them, telling them that there could be no atonement made for the sins of men, but every man fared in this life according to the management of the creature; therefore every man prospered according to his genius, and that every man conquered according to his strength; and whatsoever a man did was no crime."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,30,18,Alma 30:18,Alma 30:18,"And thus he did preach unto them, leading away the hearts of many, causing them to lift up their heads in their wickedness, yea, leading away many women, and also men, to commit whoredoms--telling them that when a man was dead, that was the end thereof."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,30,19,Alma 30:19,Alma 30:19,"Now this man went over to the land of Jershon also, to preach these things among the people of Ammon, who were once the people of the Lamanites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,30,20,Alma 30:20,Alma 30:20,"But behold they were more wise than many of the Nephites; for they took him, and bound him, and carried him before Ammon, who was a high priest over that people."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,30,21,Alma 30:21,Alma 30:21,"And it came to pass that he caused that he should be carried out of the land. And he came over into the land of Gideon, and began to preach unto them also; and here he did not have much success, for he was taken and bound and carried before the high priest, and also the chief judge over the land."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,30,22,Alma 30:22,Alma 30:22,"And it came to pass that the high priest said unto him: Why do ye go about perverting the ways of the Lord? Why do ye teach this people that there shall be no Christ, to interrupt their rejoicings? Why do ye speak against all the prophecies of the holy prophets?"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,30,23,Alma 30:23,Alma 30:23,"Now the high priest's name was Giddonah. And Korihor said unto him: Because I do not teach the foolish traditions of your fathers, and because I do not teach this people to bind themselves down under the foolish ordinances and performances which are laid down by ancient priests, to usurp power and authority over them, to keep them in ignorance, that they may not lift up their heads, but be brought down according to thy words."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,30,24,Alma 30:24,Alma 30:24,"Ye say that this people is a free people. Behold, I say they are in bondage. Ye say that those ancient prophecies are true. Behold, I say that ye do not know that they are true."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,30,27,Alma 30:27,Alma 30:27,"And thus ye lead away this people after the foolish traditions of your fathers, and according to your own desires; and ye keep them down, even as it were in bondage, that ye may glut yourselves with the labors of their hands, that they durst not look up with boldness, and that they durst not enjoy their rights and privileges."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,30,28,Alma 30:28,Alma 30:28,"Yea, they durst not make use of that which is their own lest they should offend their priests, who do yoke them according to their desires, and have brought them to believe, by their traditions and their dreams and their whims and their visions and their pretended mysteries, that they should, if they did not do according to their words, offend some unknown being, who they say is God--a being who never has been seen or known, who never was nor ever will be."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,30,29,Alma 30:29,Alma 30:29,"Now when the high priest and the chief judge saw the hardness of his heart, yea, when they saw that he would revile even against God, they would not make any reply to his words; but they caused that he should be bound; and they delivered him up into the hands of the officers, and sent him to the land of Zarahemla, that he might be brought before Alma, and the chief judge who was governor over all the land."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,30,30,Alma 30:30,Alma 30:30,"And it came to pass that when he was brought before Alma and the chief judge, he did go on in the same manner as he did in the land of Gideon; yea, he went on to blaspheme."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,30,31,Alma 30:31,Alma 30:31,"And he did rise up in great swelling words before Alma, and did revile against the priests and teachers, accusing them of leading away the people after the silly traditions of their fathers, for the sake of glutting on the labors of the people."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,30,32,Alma 30:32,Alma 30:32,"Now Alma said unto him: Thou knowest that we do not glut ourselves upon the labors of this people; for behold I have labored even from the commencement of the reign of the judges until now, with mine own hands for my support, notwithstanding my many travels round about the land to declare the word of God unto my people."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,30,33,Alma 30:33,Alma 30:33,"And notwithstanding the many labors which I have performed in the church, I have never received so much as even one senine for my labor; neither has any of my brethren, save it were in the judgment-seat; and then we have received only according to law for our time."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,30,34,Alma 30:34,Alma 30:34,"And now, if we do not receive anything for our labors in the church, what doth it profit us to labor in the church save it were to declare the truth, that we may have rejoicings in the joy of our brethren?"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,30,35,Alma 30:35,Alma 30:35,"Then why sayest thou that we preach unto this people to get gain, when thou, of thyself, knowest that we receive no gain? And now, believest thou that we deceive this people, that causes such joy in their hearts?"

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,30,39,Alma 30:39,Alma 30:39,"Now Alma said unto him: Will ye deny again that there is a God, and also deny the Christ? For behold, I say unto you, I know there is a God, and also that Christ shall come."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,30,40,Alma 30:40,Alma 30:40,"And now what evidence have ye that there is no God, or that Christ cometh not? I say unto you that ye have none, save it be your word only."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,30,43,Alma 30:43,Alma 30:43,"And now Korihor said unto Alma: If thou wilt show me a sign, that I may be convinced that there is a God, yea, show unto me that he hath power, and then will I be convinced of the truth of thy words."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,30,44,Alma 30:44,Alma 30:44,"But Alma said unto him: Thou hast had signs enough; will ye tempt your God? Will ye say, Show unto me a sign, when ye have the testimony of all these thy brethren, and also all the holy prophets? The scriptures are laid before thee, yea, and all things denote there is a God; yea, even the earth, and all things that are upon the face of it, yea, and its motion, yea, and also all the planets which move in their regular form do witness that there is a Supreme Creator."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,30,45,Alma 30:45,Alma 30:45,"And yet do ye go about, leading away the hearts of this people, testifying unto them there is no God? And yet will ye deny against all these witnesses? And he said: Yea, I will deny, except ye shall show me a sign."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,30,46,Alma 30:46,Alma 30:46,"And now it came to pass that Alma said unto him: Behold, I am grieved because of the hardness of your heart, yea, that ye will still resist the spirit of the truth, that thy soul may be destroyed."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,30,47,Alma 30:47,Alma 30:47,"But behold, it is better that thy soul should be lost than that thou shouldst be the means of bringing many souls down to destruction, by thy lying and by thy flattering words; therefore if thou shalt deny again, behold God shall smite thee, that thou shalt become dumb, that thou shalt never open thy mouth any more, that thou shalt not deceive this people any more."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,30,48,Alma 30:48,Alma 30:48,"Now Korihor said unto him: I do not deny the existence of a God, but I do not believe that there is a God; and I say also, that ye do not know that there is a God; and except ye show me a sign, I will not believe."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,30,49,Alma 30:49,Alma 30:49,"Now Alma said unto him: This will I give unto thee for a sign, that thou shalt be struck dumb, according to my words; and I say, that in the name of God, ye shall be struck dumb, that ye shall no more have utterance."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,30,50,Alma 30:50,Alma 30:50,"Now when Alma had said these words, Korihor was struck dumb, that he could not have utterance, according to the words of Alma."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,30,51,Alma 30:51,Alma 30:51,"And now when the chief judge saw this, he put forth his hand and wrote unto Korihor, saying: Art thou convinced of the power of God? In whom did ye desire that Alma should show forth his sign? Would ye that he should afflict others, to show unto thee a sign? Behold, he has showed unto you a sign; and now will ye dispute more?"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,30,52,Alma 30:52,Alma 30:52,"And Korihor put forth his hand and wrote, saying: I know that I am dumb, for I cannot speak; and I know that nothing save it were the power of God could bring this upon me; yea, and I always knew that there was a God."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,30,53,Alma 30:53,Alma 30:53,"But behold, the devil hath deceived me; for he appeared unto me in the form of an angel, and said unto me: Go and reclaim this people, for they have all gone astray after an unknown God. And he said unto me: There is no God; yea, and he taught me that which I should say. And I have taught his words; and I taught them because they were pleasing unto the carnal mind; and I taught them, even until I had much success, insomuch that I verily believed that they were true; and for this cause I withstood the truth, even until I have brought this great curse upon me."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,30,54,Alma 30:54,Alma 30:54,"Now when he had said this, he besought that Alma should pray unto God, that the curse might be taken from him."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,30,55,Alma 30:55,Alma 30:55,"But Alma said unto him: If this curse should be taken from thee thou wouldst again lead away the hearts of this people; therefore, it shall be unto thee even as the Lord will."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,30,56,Alma 30:56,Alma 30:56,"And it came to pass that the curse was not taken off of Korihor; but he was cast out, and went about from house to house begging for his food."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,30,57,Alma 30:57,Alma 30:57,"Now the knowledge of what had happened unto Korihor was immediately published throughout all the land; yea, the proclamation was sent forth by the chief judge to all the people in the land, declaring unto those who had believed in the words of Korihor that they must speedily repent, lest the same judgments would come unto them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,30,58,Alma 30:58,Alma 30:58,"And it came to pass that they were all convinced of the wickedness of Korihor; therefore they were all converted again unto the Lord; and this put an end to the iniquity after the manner of Korihor. And Korihor did go about from house to house, begging food for his support."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,30,59,Alma 30:59,Alma 30:59,"And it came to pass that as he went forth among the people, yea, among a people who had separated themselves from the Nephites and called themselves Zoramites, being led by a man whose name was Zoram--and as he went forth amongst them, behold, he was run upon and trodden down, even until he was dead."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,30,60,Alma 30:60,Alma 30:60,"And thus we see the end of him who perverteth the ways of the Lord; and thus we see that the devil will not support his children at the last day, but doth speedily drag them down to hell."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,31,1,Alma 31:1,Alma 31:1,"Now it came to pass that after the end of Korihor, Alma having received tidings that the Zoramites were perverting the ways of the Lord, and that Zoram, who was their leader, was leading the hearts of the people to bow down to dumb idols, his heart again began to sicken because of the iniquity of the people."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,31,2,Alma 31:2,Alma 31:2,For it was the cause of great sorrow to Alma to know of iniquity among his people; therefore his heart was exceedingly sorrowful because of the separation of the Zoramites from the Nephites.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,31,3,Alma 31:3,Alma 31:3,"Now the Zoramites had gathered themselves together in a land which they called Antionum, which was east of the land of Zarahemla, which lay nearly bordering upon the seashore, which was south of the land of Jershon, which also bordered upon the wilderness south, which wilderness was full of the Lamanites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,31,4,Alma 31:4,Alma 31:4,"Now the Nephites greatly feared that the Zoramites would enter into a correspondence with the Lamanites, and that it would be the means of great loss on the part of the Nephites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,31,5,Alma 31:5,Alma 31:5,"And now, as the preaching of the word had a great tendency to lead the people to do that which was just--yea, it had had more powerful effect upon the minds of the people than the sword, or anything else, which had happened unto them--therefore Alma thought it was expedient that they should try the virtue of the word of God."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,31,6,Alma 31:6,Alma 31:6,"Therefore he took Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner; and Himni he did leave in the church in Zarahemla; but the former three he took with him, and also Amulek and Zeezrom, who were at Melek; and he also took two of his sons."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,31,7,Alma 31:7,Alma 31:7,"Now the eldest of his sons he took not with him, and his name was Helaman; but the names of those whom he took with him were Shiblon and Corianton; and these are the names of those who went with him among the Zoramites, to preach unto them the word."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,31,8,Alma 31:8,Alma 31:8,Now the Zoramites were dissenters from the Nephites; therefore they had had the word of God preached unto them.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,31,9,Alma 31:9,Alma 31:9,"But they had fallen into great errors, for they would not observe to keep the commandments of God, and his statutes, according to the law of Moses."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,31,10,Alma 31:10,Alma 31:10,"Neither would they observe the performances of the church, to continue in prayer and supplication to God daily, that they might not enter into temptation."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,31,11,Alma 31:11,Alma 31:11,"Yea, in fine, they did pervert the ways of the Lord in very many instances; therefore, for this cause, Alma and his brethren went into the land to preach the word unto them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,31,12,Alma 31:12,Alma 31:12,"Now, when they had come into the land, behold, to their astonishment they found that the Zoramites had built synagogues, and that they did gather themselves together on one day of the week, which day they did call the day of the Lord; and they did worship after a manner which Alma and his brethren had never beheld;"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,31,13,Alma 31:13,Alma 31:13,"For they had a place built up in the center of their synagogue, a place for standing, which was high above the head; and the top thereof would only admit one person."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,31,14,Alma 31:14,Alma 31:14,"Therefore, whosoever desired to worship must go forth and stand upon the top thereof, and stretch forth his hands towards heaven, and cry with a loud voice, saying:"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,31,15,Alma 31:15,Alma 31:15,"Holy, holy God; we believe that thou art God, and we believe that thou art holy, and that thou wast a spirit, and that thou art a spirit, and that thou wilt be a spirit forever."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,31,16,Alma 31:16,Alma 31:16,"Holy God, we believe that thou hast separated us from our brethren; and we do not believe in the tradition of our brethren, which was handed down to them by the childishness of their fathers; but we believe that thou hast elected us to be thy holy children; and also thou hast made it known unto us that there shall be no Christ."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,31,17,Alma 31:17,Alma 31:17,"But thou art the same yesterday, today, and forever; and thou hast elected us that we shall be saved, whilst all around us are elected to be cast by thy wrath down to hell; for the which holiness, O God, we thank thee; and we also thank thee that thou hast elected us, that we may not be led away after the foolish traditions of our brethren, which doth bind them down to a belief of Christ, which doth lead their hearts to wander far from thee, our God."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,31,18,Alma 31:18,Alma 31:18,"And again we thank thee, O God, that we are a chosen and a holy people. Amen."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,31,19,Alma 31:19,Alma 31:19,"Now it came to pass that after Alma and his brethren and his sons had heard these prayers, they were astonished beyond all measure."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,31,20,Alma 31:20,Alma 31:20,"For behold, every man did go forth and offer up these same prayers."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,31,21,Alma 31:21,Alma 31:21,"Now the place was called by them Rameumptom, which, being interpreted, is the holy stand."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,31,22,Alma 31:22,Alma 31:22,"Now, from this stand they did offer up, every man, the selfsame prayer unto God, thanking their God that they were chosen of him, and that he did not lead them away after the tradition of their brethren, and that their hearts were not stolen away to believe in things to come, which they knew nothing about."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,31,23,Alma 31:23,Alma 31:23,"Now, after the people had all offered up thanks after this manner, they returned to their homes, never speaking of their God again until they had assembled themselves together again to the holy stand, to offer up thanks after their manner."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,31,24,Alma 31:24,Alma 31:24,"Now when Alma saw this his heart was grieved; for he saw that they were a wicked and a perverse people; yea, he saw that their hearts were set upon gold, and upon silver, and upon all manner of fine goods."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,31,25,Alma 31:25,Alma 31:25,"Yea, and he also saw that their hearts were lifted up unto great boasting, in their pride."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,31,26,Alma 31:26,Alma 31:26,"And he lifted up his voice to heaven, and cried, saying: O, how long, O Lord, wilt thou suffer that thy servants shall dwell here below in the flesh, to behold such gross wickedness among the children of men?"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,31,27,Alma 31:27,Alma 31:27,"Behold, O God, they cry unto thee, and yet their hearts are swallowed up in their pride. Behold, O God, they cry unto thee with their mouths, while they are puffed up, even to greatness, with the vain things of the world."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,32,1,Alma 32:1,Alma 32:1,"And it came to pass that they did go forth, and began to preach the word of God unto the people, entering into their synagogues, and into their houses; yea, and even they did preach the word in their streets."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,32,2,Alma 32:2,Alma 32:2,"And it came to pass that after much labor among them, they began to have success among the poor class of people; for behold, they were cast out of the synagogues because of the coarseness of their apparel--"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,32,3,Alma 32:3,Alma 32:3,"Therefore they were not permitted to enter into their synagogues to worship God, being esteemed as filthiness; therefore they were poor; yea, they were esteemed by their brethren as dross; therefore they were poor as to things of the world; and also they were poor in heart."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,32,4,Alma 32:4,Alma 32:4,"Now, as Alma was teaching and speaking unto the people upon the hill Onidah, there came a great multitude unto him, who were those of whom we have been speaking, of whom were poor in heart, because of their poverty as to the things of the world."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,32,5,Alma 32:5,Alma 32:5,"And they came unto Alma; and the one who was the foremost among them said unto him: Behold, what shall these my brethren do, for they are despised of all men because of their poverty, yea, and more especially by our priests; for they have cast us out of our synagogues which we have labored abundantly to build with our own hands; and they have cast us out because of our exceeding poverty; and we have no place to worship our God; and behold, what shall we do?"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,32,6,Alma 32:6,Alma 32:6,"And now when Alma heard this, he turned him about, his face immediately towards him, and he beheld with great joy; for he beheld that their afflictions had truly humbled them, and that they were in a preparation to hear the word."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,32,13,Alma 32:13,Alma 32:13,"And now, because ye are compelled to be humble blessed are ye; for a man sometimes, if he is compelled to be humble, seeketh repentance; and now surely, whosoever repenteth shall find mercy; and he that findeth mercy and endureth to the end the same shall be saved."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,32,14,Alma 32:14,Alma 32:14,"And now, as I said unto you, that because ye were compelled to be humble ye were blessed, do ye not suppose that they are more blessed who truly humble themselves because of the word?"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,32,15,Alma 32:15,Alma 32:15,"Yea, he that truly humbleth himself, and repenteth of his sins, and endureth to the end, the same shall be blessed--yea, much more blessed than they who are compelled to be humble because of their exceeding poverty."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,32,16,Alma 32:16,Alma 32:16,"Therefore, blessed are they who humble themselves without being compelled to be humble; or rather, in other words, blessed is he that believeth in the word of God, and is baptized without stubbornness of heart, yea, without being brought to know the word, or even compelled to know, before they will believe."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,32,17,Alma 32:17,Alma 32:17,"Yea, there are many who do say: If thou wilt show unto us a sign from heaven, then we shall know of a surety; then we shall believe."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,32,18,Alma 32:18,Alma 32:18,"Now I ask, is this faith? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; for if a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,32,19,Alma 32:19,Alma 32:19,"And now, how much more cursed is he that knoweth the will of God and doeth it not, than he that only believeth, or only hath cause to believe, and falleth into transgression?"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,32,20,Alma 32:20,Alma 32:20,"Now of this thing ye must judge. Behold, I say unto you, that it is on the one hand even as it is on the other; and it shall be unto every man according to his work."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,32,21,Alma 32:21,Alma 32:21,"And now as I said concerning faith--faith is not to have a perfect knowledge of things; therefore if ye have faith ye hope for things which are not seen, which are true."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,32,22,Alma 32:22,Alma 32:22,"And now, behold, I say unto you, and I would that ye should remember, that God is merciful unto all who believe on his name; therefore he desireth, in the first place, that ye should believe, yea, even on his word."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,32,23,Alma 32:23,Alma 32:23,"And now, he imparteth his word by angels unto men, yea, not only men but women also. Now this is not all; little children do have words given unto them many times, which confound the wise and the learned."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,32,24,Alma 32:24,Alma 32:24,"And now, my beloved brethren, as ye have desired to know of me what ye shall do because ye are afflicted and cast out--now I do not desire that ye should suppose that I mean to judge you only according to that which is true--"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,32,25,Alma 32:25,Alma 32:25,"For I do not mean that ye all of you have been compelled to humble yourselves; for I verily believe that there are some among you who would humble themselves, let them be in whatsoever circumstances they might."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,32,26,Alma 32:26,Alma 32:26,"Now, as I said concerning faith--that it was not a perfect knowledge--even so it is with my words. Ye cannot know of their surety at first, unto perfection, any more than faith is a perfect knowledge."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,32,27,Alma 32:27,Alma 32:27,"But behold, if ye will awake and arouse your faculties, even to an experiment upon my words, and exercise a particle of faith, yea, even if ye can no more than desire to believe, let this desire work in you, even until ye believe in a manner that ye can give place for a portion of my words."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,32,28,Alma 32:28,Alma 32:28,"Now, we will compare the word unto a seed. Now, if ye give place, that a seed may be planted in your heart, behold, if it be a true seed, or a good seed, if ye do not cast it out by your unbelief, that ye will resist the Spirit of the Lord, behold, it will begin to swell within your breasts; and when you feel these swelling motions, ye will begin to say within yourselves--It must needs be that this is a good seed, or that the word is good, for it beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my understanding, yea, it beginneth to be delicious to me."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,32,29,Alma 32:29,Alma 32:29,"Now behold, would not this increase your faith? I say unto you, Yea; nevertheless it hath not grown up to a perfect knowledge."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,32,30,Alma 32:30,Alma 32:30,"But behold, as the seed swelleth, and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow, then you must needs say that the seed is good; for behold it swelleth, and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow. And now, behold, will not this strengthen your faith? Yea, it will strengthen your faith: for ye will say I know that this is a good seed; for behold it sprouteth and beginneth to grow."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,32,31,Alma 32:31,Alma 32:31,"And now, behold, are ye sure that this is a good seed? I say unto you, Yea; for every seed bringeth forth unto its own likeness."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,32,32,Alma 32:32,Alma 32:32,"Therefore, if a seed groweth it is good, but if it groweth not, behold it is not good, therefore it is cast away."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,32,33,Alma 32:33,Alma 32:33,"And now, behold, because ye have tried the experiment, and planted the seed, and it swelleth and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow, ye must needs know that the seed is good."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,32,34,Alma 32:34,Alma 32:34,"And now, behold, is your knowledge perfect? Yea, your knowledge is perfect in that thing, and your faith is dormant; and this because you know, for ye know that the word hath swelled your souls, and ye also know that it hath sprouted up, that your understanding doth begin to be enlightened, and your mind doth begin to expand."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,32,35,Alma 32:35,Alma 32:35,"O then, is not this real? I say unto you, Yea, because it is light; and whatsoever is light, is good, because it is discernible, therefore ye must know that it is good; and now behold, after ye have tasted this light is your knowledge perfect?"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,32,36,Alma 32:36,Alma 32:36,"Behold I say unto you, Nay; neither must ye lay aside your faith, for ye have only exercised your faith to plant the seed that ye might try the experiment to know if the seed was good."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,32,37,Alma 32:37,Alma 32:37,"And behold, as the tree beginneth to grow, ye will say: Let us nourish it with great care, that it may get root, that it may grow up, and bring forth fruit unto us. And now behold, if ye nourish it with much care it will get root, and grow up, and bring forth fruit."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,32,38,Alma 32:38,Alma 32:38,"But if ye neglect the tree, and take no thought for its nourishment, behold it will not get any root; and when the heat of the sun cometh and scorcheth it, because it hath no root it withers away, and ye pluck it up and cast it out."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,32,39,Alma 32:39,Alma 32:39,"Now, this is not because the seed was not good, neither is it because the fruit thereof would not be desirable; but it is because your ground is barren, and ye will not nourish the tree, therefore ye cannot have the fruit thereof."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,32,40,Alma 32:40,Alma 32:40,"And thus, if ye will not nourish the word, looking forward with an eye of faith to the fruit thereof, ye can never pluck of the fruit of the tree of life."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,32,41,Alma 32:41,Alma 32:41,"But if ye will nourish the word, yea, nourish the tree as it beginneth to grow, by your faith with great diligence, and with patience, looking forward to the fruit thereof, it shall take root; and behold it shall be a tree springing up unto everlasting life."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,32,42,Alma 32:42,Alma 32:42,"And because of your diligence and your faith and your patience with the word in nourishing it, that it may take root in you, behold, by and by ye shall pluck the fruit thereof, which is most precious, which is sweet above all that is sweet, and which is white above all that is white, yea, and pure above all that is pure; and ye shall feast upon this fruit even until ye are filled, that ye hunger not, neither shall ye thirst."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,32,43,Alma 32:43,Alma 32:43,"Then, my brethren, ye shall reap the rewards of your faith, and your diligence, and patience, and long-suffering, waiting for the tree to bring forth fruit unto you."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,33,1,Alma 33:1,Alma 33:1,"Now after Alma had spoken these words, they sent forth unto him desiring to know whether they should believe in one God, that they might obtain this fruit of which he had spoken, or how they should plant the seed, or the word of which he had spoken, which he said must be planted in their hearts; or in what manner they should begin to exercise their faith."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,33,2,Alma 33:2,Alma 33:2,"And Alma said unto them: Behold, ye have said that ye could not worship your God because ye are cast out of your synagogues. But behold, I say unto you, if ye suppose that ye cannot worship God, ye do greatly err, and ye ought to search the scriptures; if ye suppose that they have taught you this, ye do not understand them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,33,3,Alma 33:3,Alma 33:3,"Do ye remember to have read what Zenos, the prophet of old, has said concerning prayer or worship?"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,33,4,Alma 33:4,Alma 33:4,"For he said: Thou art merciful, O God, for thou hast heard my prayer, even when I was in the wilderness; yea, thou wast merciful when I prayed concerning those who were mine enemies, and thou didst turn them to me."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,33,5,Alma 33:5,Alma 33:5,"Yea, O God, and thou wast merciful unto me when I did cry unto thee in my field; when I did cry unto thee in my prayer, and thou didst hear me."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,33,6,Alma 33:6,Alma 33:6,"And again, O God, when I did turn to my house thou didst hear me in my prayer."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,33,7,Alma 33:7,Alma 33:7,"And when I did turn unto my closet, O Lord, and prayed unto thee, thou didst hear me."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,33,8,Alma 33:8,Alma 33:8,"Yea, thou art merciful unto thy children when they cry unto thee, to be heard of thee and not of men, and thou wilt hear them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,33,9,Alma 33:9,Alma 33:9,"Yea, O God, thou hast been merciful unto me, and heard my cries in the midst of thy congregations."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,33,10,Alma 33:10,Alma 33:10,"Yea, and thou hast also heard me when I have been cast out and have been despised by mine enemies; yea, thou didst hear my cries, and wast angry with mine enemies, and thou didst visit them in thine anger with speedy destruction."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,33,11,Alma 33:11,Alma 33:11,"And thou didst hear me because of mine afflictions and my sincerity; and it is because of thy Son that thou hast been thus merciful unto me, therefore I will cry unto thee in all mine afflictions, for in thee is my joy; for thou hast turned thy judgments away from me, because of thy Son."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,33,12,Alma 33:12,Alma 33:12,And now Alma said unto them: Do ye believe those scriptures which have been written by them of old?
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,33,13,Alma 33:13,Alma 33:13,"Behold, if ye do, ye must believe what Zenos said; for, behold he said: Thou hast turned away thy judgments because of thy Son."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,33,14,Alma 33:14,Alma 33:14,"Now behold, my brethren, I would ask if ye have read the scriptures? If ye have, how can ye disbelieve on the Son of God?"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,33,15,Alma 33:15,Alma 33:15,"For it is not written that Zenos alone spake of these things, but Zenock also spake of these things--"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,33,16,Alma 33:16,Alma 33:16,"For behold, he said: Thou art angry, O Lord, with this people, because they will not understand thy mercies which thou hast bestowed upon them because of thy Son."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,33,17,Alma 33:17,Alma 33:17,"And now, my brethren, ye see that a second prophet of old has testified of the Son of God, and because the people would not understand his words they stoned him to death."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,33,18,Alma 33:18,Alma 33:18,"But behold, this is not all; these are not the only ones who have spoken concerning the Son of God."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,33,19,Alma 33:19,Alma 33:19,"Behold, he was spoken of by Moses; yea, and behold a type was raised up in the wilderness, that whosoever would look upon it might live. And many did look and live."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,33,20,Alma 33:20,Alma 33:20,"But few understood the meaning of those things, and this because of the hardness of their hearts. But there were many who were so hardened that they would not look, therefore they perished. Now the reason they would not look is because they did not believe that it would heal them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,33,21,Alma 33:21,Alma 33:21,"O my brethren, if ye could be healed by merely casting about your eyes that ye might be healed, would ye not behold quickly, or would ye rather harden your hearts in unbelief, and be slothful, that ye would not cast about your eyes, that ye might perish?"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,33,22,Alma 33:22,Alma 33:22,"If so, wo shall come upon you; but if not so, then cast about your eyes and begin to believe in the Son of God, that he will come to redeem his people, and that he shall suffer and die to atone for their sins; and that he shall rise again from the dead, which shall bring to pass the resurrection, that all men shall stand before him, to be judged at the last and judgment day, according to their works."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,33,23,Alma 33:23,Alma 33:23,"And now, my brethren, I desire that ye shall plant this word in your hearts, and as it beginneth to swell even so nourish it by your faith. And behold, it will become a tree, springing up in you unto everlasting life. And then may God grant unto you that your burdens may be light, through the joy of his Son. And even all this can ye do if ye will. Amen."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,34,1,Alma 34:1,Alma 34:1,"And now it came to pass that after Alma had spoken these words unto them he sat down upon the ground, and Amulek arose and began to teach them, saying:"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,34,2,Alma 34:2,Alma 34:2,"My brethren, I think that it is impossible that ye should be ignorant of the things which have been spoken concerning the coming of Christ, who is taught by us to be the Son of God; yea, I know that these things were taught unto you bountifully before your dissension from among us."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,34,3,Alma 34:3,Alma 34:3,"And as ye have desired of my beloved brother that he should make known unto you what ye should do, because of your afflictions; and he hath spoken somewhat unto you to prepare your minds; yea, and he hath exhorted you unto faith and to patience--"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,34,4,Alma 34:4,Alma 34:4,"Yea, even that ye would have so much faith as even to plant the word in your hearts, that ye may try the experiment of its goodness."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,34,5,Alma 34:5,Alma 34:5,"And we have beheld that the great question which is in your minds is whether the word be in the Son of God, or whether there shall be no Christ."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,34,6,Alma 34:6,Alma 34:6,"And ye also beheld that my brother has proved unto you, in many instances, that the word is in Christ unto salvation."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,34,7,Alma 34:7,Alma 34:7,"My brother has called upon the words of Zenos, that redemption cometh through the Son of God, and also upon the words of Zenock; and also he has appealed unto Moses, to prove that these things are true."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,34,8,Alma 34:8,Alma 34:8,"And now, behold, I will testify unto you of myself that these things are true. Behold, I say unto you, that I do know that Christ shall come among the children of men, to take upon him the transgressions of his people, and that he shall atone for the sins of the world; for the Lord God hath spoken it."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,34,9,Alma 34:9,Alma 34:9,"For it is expedient that an atonement should be made; for according to the great plan of the Eternal God there must be an atonement made, or else all mankind must unavoidably perish; yea, all are hardened; yea, all are fallen and are lost, and must perish except it be through the atonement which it is expedient should be made."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,34,10,Alma 34:10,Alma 34:10,"For it is expedient that there should be a great and last sacrifice; yea, not a sacrifice of man, neither of beast, neither of any manner of fowl; for it shall not be a human sacrifice; but it must be an infinite and eternal sacrifice."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,34,11,Alma 34:11,Alma 34:11,"Now there is not any man that can sacrifice his own blood which will atone for the sins of another. Now, if a man murdereth, behold will our law, which is just, take the life of his brother? I say unto you, Nay."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,34,12,Alma 34:12,Alma 34:12,But the law requireth the life of him who hath murdered; therefore there can be nothing which is short of an infinite atonement which will suffice for the sins of the world.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,34,13,Alma 34:13,Alma 34:13,"Therefore, it is expedient that there should be a great and last sacrifice, and then shall there be, or it is expedient there should be, a stop to the shedding of blood; then shall the law of Moses be fulfilled; yea, it shall be all fulfilled, every jot and tittle, and none shall have passed away."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,34,14,Alma 34:14,Alma 34:14,"And behold, this is the whole meaning of the law, every whit pointing to that great and last sacrifice; and that great and last sacrifice will be the Son of God, yea, infinite and eternal."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,34,15,Alma 34:15,Alma 34:15,"And thus he shall bring salvation to all those who shall believe on his name; this being the intent of this last sacrifice, to bring about the bowels of mercy, which overpowereth justice, and bringeth about means unto men that they may have faith unto repentance."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,34,16,Alma 34:16,Alma 34:16,"And thus mercy can satisfy the demands of justice, and encircles them in the arms of safety, while he that exercises no faith unto repentance is exposed to the whole law of the demands of justice; therefore only unto him that has faith unto repentance is brought about the great and eternal plan of redemption."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,34,17,Alma 34:17,Alma 34:17,"Therefore may God grant unto you, my brethren, that ye may begin to exercise your faith unto repentance, that ye begin to call upon his holy name, that he would have mercy upon you;"

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,34,28,Alma 34:28,Alma 34:28,"And now behold, my beloved brethren, I say unto you, do not suppose that this is all; for after ye have done all these things, if ye turn away the needy, and the naked, and visit not the sick and afflicted, and impart of your substance, if ye have, to those who stand in need--I say unto you, if ye do not any of these things, behold, your prayer is vain, and availeth you nothing, and ye are as hypocrites who do deny the faith."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,34,35,Alma 34:35,Alma 34:35,"For behold, if ye have procrastinated the day of your repentance even until death, behold, ye have become subjected to the spirit of the devil, and he doth seal you his; therefore, the Spirit of the Lord hath withdrawn from you, and hath no place in you, and the devil hath all power over you; and this is the final state of the wicked."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,39,2,Alma 39:2,Alma 39:2,"For thou didst not give so much heed unto my words as did thy brother, among the people of the Zoramites. Now this is what I have against thee; thou didst go on unto boasting in thy strength and thy wisdom."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,40,12,Alma 40:12,Alma 40:12,"And then shall it come to pass, that the spirits of those who are righteous are received into a state of happiness, which is called paradise, a state of rest, a state of peace, where they shall rest from all their troubles and from all care, and sorrow."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,40,15,Alma 40:15,Alma 40:15,"Now, there are some that have understood that this state of happiness and this state of misery of the soul, before the resurrection, was a first resurrection. Yea, I admit it may be termed a resurrection, the raising of the spirit or the soul and their consignation to happiness or misery, according to the words which have been spoken."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,40,16,Alma 40:16,Alma 40:16,"And behold, again it hath been spoken, that there is a first resurrection, a resurrection of all those who have been, or who are, or who shall be, down to the resurrection of Christ from the dead."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,40,17,Alma 40:17,Alma 40:17,"Now, we do not suppose that this first resurrection, which is spoken of in this manner, can be the resurrection of the souls and their consignation to happiness or misery. Ye cannot suppose that this is what it meaneth."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,40,18,Alma 40:18,Alma 40:18,"Behold, I say unto you, Nay; but it meaneth the reuniting of the soul with the body, of those from the days of Adam down to the resurrection of Christ."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,40,19,Alma 40:19,Alma 40:19,"Now, whether the souls and the bodies of those of whom has been spoken shall all be reunited at once, the wicked as well as the righteous, I do not say; let it suffice, that I say that they all come forth; or in other words, their resurrection cometh to pass before the resurrection of those who die after the resurrection of Christ."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,40,20,Alma 40:20,Alma 40:20,"Now, my son, I do not say that their resurrection cometh at the resurrection of Christ; but behold, I give it as my opinion, that the souls and the bodies are reunited, of the righteous, at the resurrection of Christ, and his ascension into heaven."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,40,21,Alma 40:21,Alma 40:21,"But whether it be at his resurrection or after, I do not say; but this much I say, that there is a space between death and the resurrection of the body, and a state of the soul in happiness or in misery until the time which is appointed of God that the dead shall come forth, and be reunited, both soul and body, and be brought to stand before God, and be judged according to their works."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,41,1,Alma 41:1,Alma 41:1,"And now, my son, I have somewhat to say concerning the restoration of which has been spoken; for behold, some have wrested the scriptures, and have gone far astray because of this thing. And I perceive that thy mind has been worried also concerning this thing. But behold, I will explain it unto thee."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,41,2,Alma 41:2,Alma 41:2,"I say unto thee, my son, that the plan of restoration is requisite with the justice of God; for it is requisite that all things should be restored to their proper order. Behold, it is requisite and just, according to the power and resurrection of Christ, that the soul of man should be restored to its body, and that every part of the body should be restored to itself."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,41,3,Alma 41:3,Alma 41:3,"And it is requisite with the justice of God that men should be judged according to their works; and if their works were good in this life, and the desires of their hearts were good, that they should also, at the last day, be restored unto that which is good."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,41,4,Alma 41:4,Alma 41:4,"And if their works are evil they shall be restored unto them for evil.

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,41,5,Alma 41:5,Alma 41:5,"The one raised to happiness according to his desires of happiness, or good according to his desires of good; and the other to evil according to his desires of evil; for as he has desired to do evil all the day long even so shall he have his reward of evil when the night cometh."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,41,6,Alma 41:6,Alma 41:6,"And so it is on the other hand. If he hath repented of his sins, and desired righteousness until the end of his days, even so he shall be rewarded unto righteousness."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,41,10,Alma 41:10,Alma 41:10,"Do not suppose, because it has been spoken concerning restoration, that ye shall be restored from sin to happiness. Behold, I say unto you, wickedness never was happiness."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,41,11,Alma 41:11,Alma 41:11,"And now, my son, all men that are in a state of nature, or I would say, in a carnal state, are in the gall of bitterness and in the bonds of iniquity; they are without God in the world, and they have gone contrary to the nature of God; therefore, they are in a state contrary to the nature of happiness."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,41,12,Alma 41:12,Alma 41:12,"And now behold, is the meaning of the word restoration to take a thing of a natural state and place it in an unnatural state, or to place it in a state opposite to its nature?"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,41,13,Alma 41:13,Alma 41:13,"O, my son, this is not the case; but the meaning of the word restoration is to bring back again evil for evil, or carnal for carnal, or devilish for devilish--good for that which is good; righteous for that which is righteous; just for that which is just; merciful for that which is merciful."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,41,14,Alma 41:14,Alma 41:14,"Therefore, my son, see that you are merciful unto your brethren; deal justly, judge righteously, and do good continually; and if ye do all these things then shall ye receive your reward; yea, ye shall have mercy restored unto you again; ye shall have justice restored unto you again; ye shall have a righteous judgment restored unto you again; and ye shall have good rewarded unto you again."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,41,15,Alma 41:15,Alma 41:15,"For that which ye do send out shall return unto you again, and be restored; therefore, the word restoration more fully condemneth the sinner, and justifieth him not at all."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,42,1,Alma 42:1,Alma 42:1,"And now, my son, I perceive there is somewhat more which doth worry your mind, which ye cannot understand--which is concerning the justice of God in the punishment of the sinner; for ye do try to suppose that it is injustice that the sinner should be consigned to a state of misery."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,42,2,Alma 42:2,Alma 42:2,"Now behold, my son, I will explain this thing unto thee. For behold, after the Lord God sent our first parents forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground, from whence they were taken--yea, he drew out the man, and he placed at the east end of the garden of Eden, cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the tree of life--"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,42,3,Alma 42:3,Alma 42:3,"Now, we see that the man had become as God, knowing good and evil; and lest he should put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat and live forever, the Lord God placed cherubim and the flaming sword, that he should not partake of the fruit--"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,42,4,Alma 42:4,Alma 42:4,"And thus we see, that there was a time granted unto man to repent, yea, a probationary time, a time to repent and serve God."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,42,5,Alma 42:5,Alma 42:5,"For behold, if Adam had put forth his hand immediately, and partaken of the tree of life, he would have lived forever, according to the word of God, having no space for repentance; yea, and also the word of God would have been void, and the great plan of salvation would have been frustrated."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,42,6,Alma 42:6,Alma 42:6,"But behold, it was appointed unto man to die--therefore, as they were cut off from the tree of life they should be cut off from the face of the earth--and man became lost forever, yea, they became fallen man."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,42,7,Alma 42:7,Alma 42:7,"And now, ye see by this that our first parents were cut off both temporally and spiritually from the presence of the Lord; and thus we see they became subjects to follow after their own will."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,42,8,Alma 42:8,Alma 42:8,"Now behold, it was not expedient that man should be reclaimed from this temporal death, for that would destroy the great plan of happiness."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,42,9,Alma 42:9,Alma 42:9,"Therefore, as the soul could never die, and the fall had brought upon all mankind a spiritual death as well as a temporal, that is, they were cut off from the presence of the Lord, it was expedient that mankind should be reclaimed from this spiritual death."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,42,10,Alma 42:10,Alma 42:10,"Therefore, as they had become carnal, sensual, and devilish, by nature, this probationary state became a state for them to prepare; it became a preparatory state."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,42,11,Alma 42:11,Alma 42:11,"And now remember, my son, if it were not for the plan of redemption, (laying it aside) as soon as they were dead their souls were miserable, being cut off from the presence of the Lord."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,42,12,Alma 42:12,Alma 42:12,"And now, there was no means to reclaim men from this fallen state, which man had brought upon himself because of his own disobedience;"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,42,13,Alma 42:13,Alma 42:13,"Therefore, according to justice, the plan of redemption could not be brought about, only on conditions of repentance of men in this probationary state, yea, this preparatory state; for except it were for these conditions, mercy could not take effect except it should destroy the work of justice. Now the work of justice could not be destroyed; if so, God would cease to be God."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,42,14,Alma 42:14,Alma 42:14,"And thus we see that all mankind were fallen, and they were in the grasp of justice; yea, the justice of God, which consigned them forever to be cut off from his presence."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,42,15,Alma 42:15,Alma 42:15,"And now, the plan of mercy could not be brought about except an atonement should be made; therefore God himself atoneth for the sins of the world, to bring about the plan of mercy, to appease the demands of justice, that God might be a perfect, just God, and a merciful God also."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,42,16,Alma 42:16,Alma 42:16,"Now, repentance could not come unto men except there were a punishment, which also was eternal as the life of the soul should be, affixed opposite to the plan of happiness, which was as eternal also as the life of the soul."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,42,17,Alma 42:17,Alma 42:17,"Now, how could a man repent except he should sin? How could he sin if there was no law? How could there be a law save there was a punishment?"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,42,18,Alma 42:18,Alma 42:18,"Now, there was a punishment affixed, and a just law given, which brought remorse of conscience unto man."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,42,19,Alma 42:19,Alma 42:19,"Now, if there was no law given--if a man murdered he should die--would he be afraid he would die if he should murder?"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,42,20,Alma 42:20,Alma 42:20,"And also, if there was no law given against sin men would not be afraid to sin."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,42,23,Alma 42:23,Alma 42:23,"But God ceaseth not to be God, and mercy claimeth the penitent, and mercy cometh because of the atonement; and the atonement bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead; and the resurrection of the dead bringeth back men into the presence of God; and thus they are restored into his presence, to be judged according to their works, according to the law and justice."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,42,24,Alma 42:24,Alma 42:24,"For behold, justice exerciseth all his demands, and also mercy claimeth all which is her own; and thus, none but the truly penitent are saved."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,42,25,Alma 42:25,Alma 42:25,"What, do ye suppose that mercy can rob justice? I say unto you, Nay; not one whit. If so, God would cease to be God."

Do not endeavor to excuse yourself in the least point because of your sins, by denying the justice of God; but do you let the justice of God, and his mercy, and his long-suffering have full sway in your heart; and let it bring you down to the dust in humility."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,42,31,Alma 42:31,Alma 42:31,"And now, O my son, ye are called of God to preach the word unto this people.

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,43,4,Alma 43:4,Alma 43:4,"For behold, it came to pass that the Zoramites became Lamanites; therefore, in the commencement of the eighteenth year the people of the Nephites saw that the Lamanites were coming upon them; therefore they made preparations for war; yea, they gathered together their armies in the land of Jershon."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,43,5,Alma 43:5,Alma 43:5,"And it came to pass that the Lamanites came with their thousands; and they came into the land of Antionum, which is the land of the Zoramites; and a man by the name of Zerahemnah was their leader."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,43,6,Alma 43:6,Alma 43:6,"And now, as the Amalekites were of a more wicked and murderous disposition than the Lamanites were, in and of themselves, therefore, Zerahemnah appointed chief captains over the Lamanites, and they were all Amalekites and Zoramites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,43,7,Alma 43:7,Alma 43:7,"Now this he did that he might preserve their hatred towards the Nephites, that he might bring them into subjection to the accomplishment of his designs."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,43,8,Alma 43:8,Alma 43:8,"For behold, his designs were to stir up the Lamanites to anger against the Nephites; this he did that he might usurp great power over them, and also that he might gain power over the Nephites by bringing them into bondage."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,43,9,Alma 43:9,Alma 43:9,"And now the design of the Nephites was to support their lands, and their houses, and their wives, and their children, that they might preserve them from the hands of their enemies; and also that they might preserve their rights and their privileges, yea, and also their liberty, that they might worship God according to their desires."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,43,10,Alma 43:10,Alma 43:10,"For they knew that if they should fall into the hands of the Lamanites, that whosoever should worship God in spirit and in truth, the true and the living God, the Lamanites would destroy."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,43,11,Alma 43:11,Alma 43:11,"Yea, and they also knew the extreme hatred of the Lamanites towards their brethren, who were the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi, who were called the people of Ammon--and they would not take up arms, yea, they had entered into a covenant and they would not break it--therefore, if they should fall into the hands of the Lamanites they would be destroyed."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,43,12,Alma 43:12,Alma 43:12,And the Nephites would not suffer that they should be destroyed; therefore they gave them lands for their inheritance.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,43,13,Alma 43:13,Alma 43:13,"And the people of Ammon did give unto the Nephites a large portion of their substance to support their armies; and thus the Nephites were compelled, alone, to withstand against the Lamanites, who were a compound of Laman and Lemuel, and the sons of Ishmael, and all those who had dissented from the Nephites, who were Amalekites and Zoramites, and the descendants of the priests of Noah."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,43,14,Alma 43:14,Alma 43:14,"Now those descendants were as numerous, nearly, as were the Nephites; and thus the Nephites were obliged to contend with their brethren, even unto bloodshed."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,43,20,Alma 43:20,Alma 43:20,"Now the army of Zerahemnah was not prepared with any such thing; they had only their swords and their cimeters, their bows and their arrows, their stones and their slings; and they were naked, save it were a skin which was girded about their loins; yea, all were naked, save it were the Zoramites and the Amalekites;"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,43,21,Alma 43:21,Alma 43:21,"But they were not armed with breastplates, nor shields--therefore, they were exceedingly afraid of the armies of the Nephites because of their armor, notwithstanding their number being so much greater than the Nephites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,43,22,Alma 43:22,Alma 43:22,"Behold, now it came to pass that they durst not come against the Nephites in the borders of Jershon; therefore they departed out of the land of Antionum into the wilderness, and took their journey round about in the wilderness, away by the head of the river Sidon, that they might come into the land of Manti and take possession of the land; for they did not suppose that the armies of Moroni would know whither they had gone."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,43,23,Alma 43:23,Alma 43:23,"But it came to pass, as soon as they had departed into the wilderness Moroni sent spies into the wilderness to watch their camp; and Moroni, also, knowing of the prophecies of Alma, sent certain men unto him, desiring him that he should inquire of the Lord whither the armies of the Nephites should go to defend themselves against the Lamanites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,43,24,Alma 43:24,Alma 43:24,"And it came to pass that the word of the Lord came unto Alma, and Alma informed the messengers of Moroni, that the armies of the Lamanites were marching round about in the wilderness, that they might come over into the land of Manti, that they might commence an attack upon the weaker part of the people. And those messengers went and delivered the message unto Moroni."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,43,25,Alma 43:25,Alma 43:25,"Now Moroni, leaving a part of his army in the land of Jershon, lest by any means a part of the Lamanites should come into that land and take possession of the city, took the remaining part of his army and marched over into the land of Manti."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,43,26,Alma 43:26,Alma 43:26,"And he caused that all the people in that quarter of the land should gather themselves together to battle against the Lamanites, to defend their lands and their country, their rights and their liberties; therefore they were prepared against the time of the coming of the Lamanites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,43,27,Alma 43:27,Alma 43:27,"And it came to pass that Moroni caused that his army should be secreted in the valley which was near the bank of the river Sidon, which was on the west of the river Sidon in the wilderness."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,43,30,Alma 43:30,Alma 43:30,"And he also knowing that it was the only desire of the Nephites to preserve their lands, and their liberty, and their church, therefore he thought it no sin that he should defend them by stratagem; therefore, he found by his spies which course the Lamanites were to take."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,43,31,Alma 43:31,Alma 43:31,"Therefore, he divided his army and brought a part over into the valley, and concealed them on the east, and on the south of the hill Riplah;"

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,43,36,Alma 43:36,Alma 43:36,"And it came to pass that the Lamanites, when they saw the Nephites coming upon them in their rear, turned them about and began to contend with the army of Lehi."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,43,37,Alma 43:37,Alma 43:37,"And the work of death commenced on both sides, but it was more dreadful on the part of the Lamanites, for their nakedness was exposed to the heavy blows of the Nephites with their swords and their cimeters, which brought death almost at every stroke."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,43,38,Alma 43:38,Alma 43:38,"While on the other hand, there was now and then a man fell among the Nephites, by their swords and the loss of blood, they being shielded from the more vital parts of the body, or the more vital parts of the body being shielded from the strokes of the Lamanites, by their breastplates, and their armshields, and their head-plates; and thus the Nephites did carry on the work of death among the Lamanites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,43,39,Alma 43:39,Alma 43:39,"And it came to pass that the Lamanites became frightened, because of the great destruction among them, even until they began to flee towards the river Sidon."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,43,43,Alma 43:43,Alma 43:43,"Now in this case the Lamanites did fight exceedingly; yea, never had the Lamanites been known to fight with such exceedingly great strength and courage, no, not even from the beginning."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,43,44,Alma 43:44,Alma 43:44,"And they were inspired by the Zoramites and the Amalekites, who were their chief captains and leaders, and by Zerahemnah, who was their chief captain, or their chief leader and commander; yea, they did fight like dragons, and many of the Nephites were slain by their hands, yea, for they did smite in two many of their head-plates, and they did pierce many of their breastplates, and they did smite off many of their arms; and thus the Lamanites did smite in their fierce anger."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,43,45,Alma 43:45,Alma 43:45,"Nevertheless, the Nephites were inspired by a better cause, for they were not fighting for monarchy nor power but they were fighting for their homes and their liberties, their wives and their children, and their all, yea, for their rites of worship and their church."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,43,46,Alma 43:46,Alma 43:46,"And they were doing that which they felt was the duty which they owed to their God; for the Lord had said unto them, and also unto their fathers, that: Inasmuch as ye are not guilty of the first offense, neither the second, ye shall not suffer yourselves to be slain by the hands of your enemies."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,43,47,Alma 43:47,Alma 43:47,"And again, the Lord has said that: Ye shall defend your families even unto bloodshed.

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,43,51,Alma 43:51,Alma 43:51,"Now, the Lamanites were more numerous, yea, by more than double the number of the Nephites; nevertheless, they were driven insomuch that they were gathered together in one body in the valley, upon the bank by the river Sidon."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,43,52,Alma 43:52,Alma 43:52,"Therefore the armies of Moroni encircled them about, yea, even on both sides of the river, for behold, on the east were the men of Lehi."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,43,53,Alma 43:53,Alma 43:53,"Therefore when Zerahemnah saw the men of Lehi on the east of the river Sidon, and the armies of Moroni on the west of the river Sidon, that they were encircled about by the Nephites, they were struck with terror."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,43,54,Alma 43:54,Alma 43:54,"Now Moroni, when he saw their terror, commanded his men that they should stop shedding their blood."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,44,1,Alma 44:1,Alma 44:1,"And it came to pass that they did stop and withdrew a pace from them. And Moroni said unto Zerahemnah: Behold, Zerahemnah, that we do not desire to be men of blood. Ye know that ye are in our hands, yet we do not desire to slay you."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,44,2,Alma 44:2,Alma 44:2,"Behold, we have not come out to battle against you that we might shed your blood for power; neither do we desire to bring any one to the yoke of bondage.

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,44,5,Alma 44:5,Alma 44:5,"And now, Zerahemnah, I command you, in the name of that all-powerful God, who has strengthened our arms that we have gained power over you, by our faith, by our religion, and by our rites of worship, and by our church, and by the sacred support which we owe to our wives and our children, by that liberty which binds us to our lands and our country; yea, and also by the maintenance of the sacred word of God, to which we owe all our happiness; and by all that is most dear unto us--"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,44,6,Alma 44:6,Alma 44:6,"Yea, and this is not all; I command you by all the desires which ye have for life, that ye deliver up your weapons of war unto us, and we will seek not your blood, but we will spare your lives, if ye will go your way and come not again to war against us."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,44,10,Alma 44:10,Alma 44:10,"And now when Zerahemnah had made an end of speaking these words, Moroni returned the sword and the weapons of war, which he had received, unto Zerahemnah, saying: Behold, we will end the conflict."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,44,11,Alma 44:11,Alma 44:11,"Now I cannot recall the words which I have spoken, therefore as the Lord liveth, ye shall not depart except ye depart with an oath that ye will not return again against us to war. Now as ye are in our hands we will spill your blood upon the ground, or ye shall submit to the conditions which I have proposed."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,44,12,Alma 44:12,Alma 44:12,"And now when Moroni had said these words, Zerahemnah retained his sword, and he was angry with Moroni, and he rushed forward that he might slay Moroni; but as he raised his sword, behold, one of Moroni's soldiers smote it even to the earth, and it broke by the hilt; and he also smote Zerahemnah that he took off his scalp and it fell to the earth. And Zerahemnah withdrew from before them into the midst of his soldiers."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,44,13,Alma 44:13,Alma 44:13,"And it came to pass that the soldier who stood by, who smote off the scalp of Zerahemnah, took up the scalp from off the ground by the hair, and laid it upon the point of his sword, and stretched it forth unto them, saying unto them with a loud voice:"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,44,14,Alma 44:14,Alma 44:14,"Even as this scalp has fallen to the earth, which is the scalp of your chief, so shall ye fall to the earth except ye will deliver up your weapons of war and depart with a covenant of peace."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,44,15,Alma 44:15,Alma 44:15,"Now there were many, when they heard these words and saw the scalp which was upon the sword, that were struck with fear; and many came forth and threw down their weapons of war at the feet of Moroni, and entered into a covenant of peace. And as many as entered into a covenant they suffered to depart into the wilderness."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,44,16,Alma 44:16,Alma 44:16,"Now it came to pass that Zerahemnah was exceedingly wroth, and he did stir up the remainder of his soldiers to anger, to contend more powerfully against the Nephites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,44,17,Alma 44:17,Alma 44:17,"And now Moroni was angry, because of the stubbornness of the Lamanites; therefore he commanded his people that they should fall upon them and slay them.

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,44,18,Alma 44:18,Alma 44:18,"But behold, their naked skins and their bare heads were exposed to the sharp swords of the Nephites; yea, behold they were pierced and smitten, yea, and did fall exceedingly fast before the swords of the Nephites; and they began to be swept down, even as the soldier of Moroni had prophesied."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,44,19,Alma 44:19,Alma 44:19,"Now Zerahemnah, when he saw that they were all about to be destroyed, cried mightily unto Moroni, promising that he would covenant and also his people with them, if they would spare the remainder of their lives, that they never would come to war again against them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,44,20,Alma 44:20,Alma 44:20,And it came to pass that Moroni caused that the work of death should cease again among the people.

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,45,18,Alma 45:18,Alma 45:18,"And when Alma had done this he departed out of the land of Zarahemla, as if to go into the land of Melek. And it came to pass that he was never heard of more; as to his death or burial we know not of."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,45,19,Alma 45:19,Alma 45:19,"Behold, this we know, that he was a righteous man; and the saying went abroad in the church that he was taken up by the Spirit, or buried by the hand of the Lord, even as Moses. But behold, the scriptures saith the Lord took Moses unto himself; and we suppose that he has also received Alma in the spirit, unto himself; therefore, for this cause we know nothing concerning his death and burial."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,45,20,Alma 45:20,Alma 45:20,"And now it came to pass in the commencement of the nineteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, that Helaman went forth among the people to declare the word unto them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,45,21,Alma 45:21,Alma 45:21,"For behold, because of their wars with the Lamanites and the many little dissensions and disturbances which had been among the people, it became expedient that the word of God should be declared among them, yea, and that a regulation should be made throughout the church."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,45,22,Alma 45:22,Alma 45:22,"Therefore, Helaman and his brethren went forth to establish the church again in all the land, yea, in every city throughout all the land which was possessed by the people of Nephi. And it came to pass that they did appoint priests and teachers throughout all the land, over all the churches."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,45,23,Alma 45:23,Alma 45:23,"And now it came to pass that after Helaman and his brethren had appointed priests and teachers over the churches that there arose a dissension among them, and they would not give heed to the words of Helaman and his brethren;"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,45,24,Alma 45:24,Alma 45:24,"But they grew proud, being lifted up in their hearts, because of their exceedingly great riches; therefore they grew rich in their own eyes, and would not give heed to their words, to walk uprightly before God."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,46,1,Alma 46:1,Alma 46:1,And it came to pass that as many as would not hearken to the words of Helaman and his brethren were gathered together against their brethren.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,46,2,Alma 46:2,Alma 46:2,"And now behold, they were exceedingly wroth, insomuch that they were determined to slay them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,46,3,Alma 46:3,Alma 46:3,Now the leader of those who were wroth against their brethren was a large and a strong man; and his name was Amalickiah.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,46,4,Alma 46:4,Alma 46:4,"And Amalickiah was desirous to be a king; and those people who were wroth were also desirous that he should be their king; and they were the greater part of them the lower judges of the land, and they were seeking for power."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,46,5,Alma 46:5,Alma 46:5,"And they had been led by the flatteries of Amalickiah, that if they would support him and establish him to be their king that he would make them rulers over the people."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,46,6,Alma 46:6,Alma 46:6,"Thus they were led away by Amalickiah to dissensions, notwithstanding the preaching of Helaman and his brethren, yea, notwithstanding their exceedingly great care over the church, for they were high priests over the church."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,46,7,Alma 46:7,Alma 46:7,"And there were many in the church who believed in the flattering words of Amalickiah, therefore they dissented even from the church; and thus were the affairs of the people of Nephi exceedingly precarious and dangerous, notwithstanding their great victory which they had had over the Lamanites, and their great rejoicings which they had had because of their deliverance by the hand of the Lord."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,46,8,Alma 46:8,Alma 46:8,"Thus we see how quick the children of men do forget the Lord their God, yea, how quick to do iniquity, and to be led away by the evil one."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,46,9,Alma 46:9,Alma 46:9,"Yea, and we also see the great wickedness one very wicked man can cause to take place among the children of men."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,46,10,Alma 46:10,Alma 46:10,"Yea, we see that Amalickiah, because he was a man of cunning device and a man of many flattering words, that he led away the hearts of many people to do wickedly; yea, and to seek to destroy the church of God, and to destroy the foundation of liberty which God had granted unto them, or which blessing God had sent upon the face of the land for the righteous' sake."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,46,11,Alma 46:11,Alma 46:11,"And now it came to pass that when Moroni, who was the chief commander of the armies of the Nephites, had heard of these dissensions, he was angry with Amalickiah."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,46,12,Alma 46:12,Alma 46:12,"And it came to pass that he rent his coat; and he took a piece thereof, and wrote upon it--In memory of our God, our religion, and freedom, and our peace, our wives, and our children--and he fastened it upon the end of a pole."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,46,13,Alma 46:13,Alma 46:13,"And he fastened on his head-plate, and his breastplate, and his shields, and girded on his armor about his loins; and he took the pole, which had on the end thereof his rent coat, (and he called it the title of liberty) and he bowed himself to the earth, and he prayed mightily unto his God for the blessings of liberty to rest upon his brethren, so long as there should a band of Christians remain to possess the land--"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,46,14,Alma 46:14,Alma 46:14,"For thus were all the true believers of Christ, who belonged to the church of God, called by those who did not belong to the church."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,46,15,Alma 46:15,Alma 46:15,"And those who did belong to the church were faithful; yea, all those who were true believers in Christ took upon them, gladly, the name of Christ, or Christians as they were called, because of their belief in Christ who should come."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,46,16,Alma 46:16,Alma 46:16,"And therefore, at this time, Moroni prayed that the cause of the Christians, and the freedom of the land might be favored."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,46,17,Alma 46:17,Alma 46:17,"And it came to pass that when he had poured out his soul to God, he named all the land which was south of the land Desolation, yea, and in fine, all the land, both on the north and on the south--A chosen land, and the land of liberty."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,46,18,Alma 46:18,Alma 46:18,"And he said: Surely God shall not suffer that we, who are despised because we take upon us the name of Christ, shall be trodden down and destroyed, until we bring it upon us by our own transgressions."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,46,19,Alma 46:19,Alma 46:19,"And when Moroni had said these words, he went forth among the people, waving the rent part of his garment in the air, that all might see the writing which he had written upon the rent part, and crying with a loud voice, saying:"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,46,20,Alma 46:20,Alma 46:20,"Behold, whosoever will maintain this title upon the land, let them come forth in the strength of the Lord, and enter into a covenant that they will maintain their rights, and their religion, that the Lord God may bless them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,46,21,Alma 46:21,Alma 46:21,"And it came to pass that when Moroni had proclaimed these words, behold, the people came running together with their armor girded about their loins, rending their garments in token, or as a covenant, that they would not forsake the Lord their God; or, in other words, if they should transgress the commandments of God, or fall into transgression, and be ashamed to take upon them the name of Christ, the Lord should rend them even as they had rent their garments."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,46,22,Alma 46:22,Alma 46:22,"Now this was the covenant which they made, and they cast their garments at the feet of Moroni, saying: We covenant with our God, that we shall be destroyed, even as our brethren in the land northward, if we shall fall into transgression; yea, he may cast us at the feet of our enemies, even as we have cast our garments at thy feet to be trodden under foot, if we shall fall into transgression."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,46,23,Alma 46:23,Alma 46:23,"Moroni said unto them: Behold, we are a remnant of the seed of Jacob; yea, we are a remnant of the seed of Joseph, whose coat was rent by his brethren into many pieces; yea, and now behold, let us remember to keep the commandments of God, or our garments shall be rent by our brethren, and we be cast into prison, or be sold, or be slain."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,46,24,Alma 46:24,Alma 46:24,"Yea, let us preserve our liberty as a remnant of Joseph; yea, let us remember the words of Jacob, before his death, for behold, he saw that a part of the remnant of the coat of Joseph was preserved and had not decayed. And he said--Even as this remnant of garment of my son hath been preserved, so shall a remnant of the seed of my son be preserved by the hand of God, and be taken unto himself, while the remainder of the seed of Joseph shall perish, even as the remnant of his garment."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,46,25,Alma 46:25,Alma 46:25,"Now behold, this giveth my soul sorrow; nevertheless, my soul hath joy in my son, because of that part of his seed which shall be taken unto God."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,46,27,Alma 46:27,Alma 46:27,"And now who knoweth but what the remnant of the seed of Joseph, which shall perish as his garment, are those who have dissented from us? Yea, and even it shall be ourselves if we do not stand fast in the faith of Christ."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,46,28,Alma 46:28,Alma 46:28,"And now it came to pass that when Moroni had said these words he went forth, and also sent forth in all the parts of the land where there were dissensions, and gathered together all the people who were desirous to maintain their liberty, to stand against Amalickiah and those who had dissented, who were called Amalickiahites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,46,29,Alma 46:29,Alma 46:29,"And it came to pass that when Amalickiah saw that the people of Moroni were more numerous than the Amalickiahites--and he also saw that his people were doubtful concerning the justice of the cause in which they had undertaken--therefore, fearing that he should not gain the point, he took those of his people who would and departed into the land of Nephi."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,46,30,Alma 46:30,Alma 46:30,"Now Moroni thought it was not expedient that the Lamanites should have any more strength; therefore he thought to cut off the people of Amalickiah, or to take them and bring them back, and put Amalickiah to death; yea, for he knew that he would stir up the Lamanites to anger against them, and cause them to come to battle against them; and this he knew that Amalickiah would do that he might obtain his purposes."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,46,31,Alma 46:31,Alma 46:31,"Therefore Moroni thought it was expedient that he should take his armies, who had gathered themselves together, and armed themselves, and entered into a covenant to keep the peace--and it came to pass that he took his army and marched out with his tents into the wilderness, to cut off the course of Amalickiah in the wilderness."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,46,32,Alma 46:32,Alma 46:32,"And it came to pass that he did according to his desires, and marched forth into the wilderness, and headed the armies of Amalickiah."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,46,34,Alma 46:34,Alma 46:34,"Now, Moroni being a man who was appointed by the chief judges and the voice of the people, therefore he had power according to his will with the armies of the Nephites, to establish and to exercise authority over them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,46,35,Alma 46:35,Alma 46:35,"And it came to pass that whomsoever of the Amalickiahites that would not enter into a covenant to support the cause of freedom, that they might maintain a free government, he caused to be put to death; and there were but few who denied the covenant of freedom."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,46,36,Alma 46:36,Alma 46:36,"And it came to pass also, that he caused the title of liberty to be hoisted upon every tower which was in all the land, which was possessed by the Nephites; and thus Moroni planted the standard of liberty among the Nephites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,46,37,Alma 46:37,Alma 46:37,And they began to have peace again in the land; and thus they did maintain peace in the land until nearly the end of the nineteenth year of the reign of the judges.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,46,38,Alma 46:38,Alma 46:38,"And Helaman and the high priests did also maintain order in the church; yea, even for the space of four years did they have much peace and rejoicing in the church."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,46,41,Alma 46:41,Alma 46:41,"But there were many who died with old age; and those who died in the faith of Christ are happy in him, as we must needs suppose."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,47,1,Alma 47:1,Alma 47:1,"Now we will return in our record to Amalickiah and those who had fled with him into the wilderness; for, behold, he had taken those who went with him, and went up in the land of Nephi among the Lamanites, and did stir up the Lamanites to anger against the people of Nephi, insomuch that the king of the Lamanites sent a proclamation throughout all his land, among all his people, that they should gather themselves together again to go to battle against the Nephites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,47,2,Alma 47:2,Alma 47:2,"And it came to pass that when the proclamation had gone forth among them they were exceedingly afraid; yea, they feared to displease the king, and they also feared to go to battle against the Nephites lest they should lose their lives. And it came to pass that they would not, or the more part of them would not, obey the commandments of the king."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,47,3,Alma 47:3,Alma 47:3,"And now it came to pass that the king was wroth because of their disobedience; therefore he gave Amalickiah the command of that part of his army which was obedient unto his commands, and commanded him that he should go forth and compel them to arms."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,47,4,Alma 47:4,Alma 47:4,"Now behold, this was the desire of Amalickiah; for he being a very subtle man to do evil therefore he laid the plan in his heart to dethrone the king of the Lamanites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,47,5,Alma 47:5,Alma 47:5,"And now he had got the command of those parts of the Lamanites who were in favor of the king; and he sought to gain favor of those who were not obedient; therefore he went forward to the place which was called Onidah, for thither had all the Lamanites fled; for they discovered the army coming, and, supposing that they were coming to destroy them, therefore they fled to Onidah, to the place of arms."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,47,6,Alma 47:6,Alma 47:6,"And they had appointed a man to be a king and a leader over them, being fixed in their minds with a determined resolution that they would not be subjected to go against the Nephites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,47,7,Alma 47:7,Alma 47:7,"And it came to pass that they had gathered themselves together upon the top of the mount which was called Antipas, in preparation to battle."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,47,8,Alma 47:8,Alma 47:8,"Now it was not Amalickiah's intention to give them battle according to the commandments of the king; but behold, it was his intention to gain favor with the armies of the Lamanites, that he might place himself at their head and dethrone the king and take possession of the kingdom."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,47,9,Alma 47:9,Alma 47:9,"And behold, it came to pass that he caused his army to pitch their tents in the valley which was near the mount Antipas."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,47,12,Alma 47:12,Alma 47:12,"And it came to pass that when Amalickiah found that he could not get Lehonti to come down off from the mount, he went up into the mount, nearly to Lehonti's camp; and he sent again the fourth time his message unto Lehonti, desiring that he would come down, and that he would bring his guards with him."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,47,13,Alma 47:13,Alma 47:13,"And it came to pass that when Lehonti had come down with his guards to Amalickiah, that Amalickiah desired him to come down with his army in the night-time, and surround those men in their camps over whom the king had given him command, and that he would deliver them up into Lehonti's hands, if he would make him (Amalickiah) a second leader over the whole army."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,47,14,Alma 47:14,Alma 47:14,"And it came to pass that Lehonti came down with his men and surrounded the men of Amalickiah, so that before they awoke at the dawn of day they were surrounded by the armies of Lehonti."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,47,15,Alma 47:15,Alma 47:15,"And it came to pass that when they saw that they were surrounded, they plead with Amalickiah that he would suffer them to fall in with their brethren, that they might not be destroyed. Now this was the very thing which Amalickiah desired."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,47,16,Alma 47:16,Alma 47:16,"And it came to pass that he delivered his men, contrary to the commands of the king. Now this was the thing that Amalickiah desired, that he might accomplish his designs in dethroning the king."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,47,17,Alma 47:17,Alma 47:17,"Now it was the custom among the Lamanites, if their chief leader was killed, to appoint the second leader to be their chief leader."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,47,22,Alma 47:22,Alma 47:22,"But behold, as the king came out to meet him Amalickiah caused that his servants should go forth to meet the king. And they went and bowed themselves before the king, as if to reverence him because of his greatness."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,47,23,Alma 47:23,Alma 47:23,"And it came to pass that the king put forth his hand to raise them, as was the custom with the Lamanites, as a token of peace, which custom they had taken from the Nephites."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,47,32,Alma 47:32,Alma 47:32,"And now it came to pass that the queen, when she had heard that the king was slain--for Amalickiah had sent an embassy to the queen informing her that the king had been slain by his servants, that he had pursued them with his army, but it was in vain, and they had made their escape--"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,47,33,Alma 47:33,Alma 47:33,"Therefore, when the queen had received this message she sent unto Amalickiah, desiring him that he would spare the people of the city; and she also desired him that he should come in unto her; and she also desired him that he should bring witnesses with him to testify concerning the death of the king."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,47,34,Alma 47:34,Alma 47:34,"And it came to pass that Amalickiah took the same servant that slew the king, and all them who were with him, and went in unto the queen, unto the place where she sat; and they all testified unto her that the king was slain by his own servants; and they said also: They have fled; does not this testify against them?

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,47,35,Alma 47:35,Alma 47:35,"And it came to pass that Amalickiah sought the favor of the queen, and took her unto him to wife; and thus by his fraud, and by the assistance of his cunning servants, he obtained the kingdom; yea, he was acknowledged king throughout all the land, among all the people of the Lamanites, who were composed of the Lamanites and the Lemuelites and the Ishmaelites, and all the dissenters of the Nephites, from the reign of Nephi down to the present time."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,47,36,Alma 47:36,Alma 47:36,"Now these dissenters, having the same instruction and the same information of the Nephites, yea, having been instructed in the same knowledge of the Lord, nevertheless, it is strange to relate, not long after their dissensions they became more hardened and impenitent, and more wild, wicked and ferocious than the Lamanites--drinking in with the traditions of the Lamanites; giving way to indolence, and all manner of lasciviousness; yea, entirely forgetting the Lord their God."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,48,1,Alma 48:1,Alma 48:1,"And now it came to pass that, as soon as Amalickiah had obtained the kingdom he began to inspire the hearts of the Lamanites against the people of Nephi; yea, he did appoint men to speak unto the Lamanites from their towers, against the Nephites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,48,2,Alma 48:2,Alma 48:2,"And thus he did inspire their hearts against the Nephites, insomuch that in the latter end of the nineteenth year of the reign of the judges, he having accomplished his designs thus far, yea, having been made king over the Lamanites, he sought also to reign over all the land, yea, and all the people who were in the land, the Nephites as well as the Lamanites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,48,3,Alma 48:3,Alma 48:3,"Therefore he had accomplished his design, for he had hardened the hearts of the Lamanites and blinded their minds, and stirred them up to anger, insomuch that he had gathered together a numerous host to go to battle against the Nephites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,48,4,Alma 48:4,Alma 48:4,"For he was determined, because of the greatness of the number of his people, to overpower the Nephites and to bring them into bondage."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,48,5,Alma 48:5,Alma 48:5,"And thus he did appoint chief captains of the Zoramites, they being the most acquainted with the strength of the Nephites, and their places of resort, and the weakest parts of their cities; therefore he appointed them to be chief captains over his armies."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,48,6,Alma 48:6,Alma 48:6,"And it came to pass that they took their camp, and moved forth toward the land of Zarahemla in the wilderness."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,48,14,Alma 48:14,Alma 48:14,"Now the Nephites were taught to defend themselves against their enemies, even to the shedding of blood if it were necessary; yea, and they were also taught never to give an offense, yea, and never to raise the sword except it were against an enemy, except it were to preserve their lives."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,48,17,Alma 48:17,Alma 48:17,"Yea, verily, verily I say unto you, if all men had been, and were, and ever would be, like unto Moroni, behold, the very powers of hell would have been shaken forever; yea, the devil would never have power over the hearts of the children of men."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,48,20,Alma 48:20,Alma 48:20,"And thus they went forth, and the people did humble themselves because of their words, insomuch that they were highly favored of the Lord, and thus they were free from wars and contentions among themselves, yea, even for the space of four years."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,48,21,Alma 48:21,Alma 48:21,"But, as I have said, in the latter end of the nineteenth year, yea, notwithstanding their peace amongst themselves, they were compelled reluctantly to contend with their brethren, the Lamanites."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,48,23,Alma 48:23,Alma 48:23,"Now, they were sorry to take up arms against the Lamanites, because they did not delight in the shedding of blood; yea, and this was not all--they were sorry to be the means of sending so many of their brethren out of this world into an eternal world, unprepared to meet their God."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,48,24,Alma 48:24,Alma 48:24,"Nevertheless, they could not suffer to lay down their lives, that their wives and their children should be massacred by the barbarous cruelty of those who were once their brethren, yea, and had dissented from their church, and had left them and had gone to destroy them by joining the Lamanites."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,49,3,Alma 49:3,Alma 49:3,"Behold, I said that the city of Ammonihah had been rebuilt. I say unto you, yea, that it was in part rebuilt; and because the Lamanites had destroyed it once because of the iniquity of the people, they supposed that it would again become an easy prey for them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,49,4,Alma 49:4,Alma 49:4,"But behold, how great was their disappointment; for behold, the Nephites had dug up a ridge of earth round about them, which was so high that the Lamanites could not cast their stones and their arrows at them that they might take effect, neither could they come upon them save it was by their place of entrance."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,49,5,Alma 49:5,Alma 49:5,"Now at this time the chief captains of the Lamanites were astonished exceedingly, because of the wisdom of the Nephites in preparing their places of security."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,49,6,Alma 49:6,Alma 49:6,"Now the leaders of the Lamanites had supposed, because of the greatness of their numbers, yea, they supposed that they should be privileged to come upon them as they had hitherto done; yea, and they had also prepared themselves with shields, and with breastplates; and they had also prepared themselves with garments of skins, yea, very thick garments to cover their nakedness."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,49,7,Alma 49:7,Alma 49:7,"And being thus prepared they supposed that they should easily overpower and subject their brethren to the yoke of bondage, or slay and massacre them according to their pleasure."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,49,8,Alma 49:8,Alma 49:8,"But behold, to their uttermost astonishment, they were prepared for them, in a manner which never had been known among the children of Lehi.

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,49,9,Alma 49:9,Alma 49:9,"And it came to pass that the Lamanites, or the Amalickiahites, were exceedingly astonished at their manner of preparation for war."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,49,10,Alma 49:10,Alma 49:10,"Now, if king Amalickiah had come down out of the land of Nephi, at the head of his army, perhaps he would have caused the Lamanites to have attacked the Nephites at the city of Ammonihah; for behold, he did care not for the blood of his people."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,49,11,Alma 49:11,Alma 49:11,"But behold, Amalickiah did not come down himself to battle. And behold, his chief captains durst not attack the Nephites at the city of Ammonihah, for Moroni had altered the management of affairs among the Nephites, insomuch that the Lamanites were disappointed in their places of retreat and they could not come upon them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,49,12,Alma 49:12,Alma 49:12,"Therefore they retreated into the wilderness, and took their camp and marched towards the land of Noah, supposing that to be the next best place for them to come against the Nephites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,49,13,Alma 49:13,Alma 49:13,"For they knew not that Moroni had fortified, or had built forts of security, for every city in all the land round about; therefore, they marched forward to the land of Noah with a firm determination; yea, their chief captains came forward and took an oath that they would destroy the people of that city."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,49,14,Alma 49:14,Alma 49:14,"But behold, to their astonishment, the city of Noah, which had hitherto been a weak place, had now, by the means of Moroni, become strong, yea, even to exceed the strength of the city Ammonihah."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,49,15,Alma 49:15,Alma 49:15,"And now, behold, this was wisdom in Moroni; for he had supposed that they would be frightened at the city Ammonihah; and as the city of Noah had hitherto been the weakest part of the land, therefore they would march thither to battle; and thus it was according to his desires."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,49,16,Alma 49:16,Alma 49:16,"And behold, Moroni had appointed Lehi to be chief captain over the men of that city; and it was that same Lehi who fought with the Lamanites in the valley on the east of the river Sidon."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,49,17,Alma 49:17,Alma 49:17,"And now behold it came to pass, that when the Lamanites had found that Lehi commanded the city they were again disappointed, for they feared Lehi exceedingly; nevertheless their chief captains had sworn with an oath to attack the city; therefore, they brought up their armies."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,49,18,Alma 49:18,Alma 49:18,"Now behold, the Lamanites could not get into their forts of security by any other way save by the entrance, because of the highness of the bank which had been thrown up, and the depth of the ditch which had been dug round about, save it were by the entrance."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,49,19,Alma 49:19,Alma 49:19,"And thus were the Nephites prepared to destroy all such as should attempt to climb up to enter the fort by any other way, by casting over stones and arrows at them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,49,20,Alma 49:20,Alma 49:20,"Thus they were prepared, yea, a body of their strongest men, with their swords and their slings, to smite down all who should attempt to come into their place of security by the place of entrance; and thus were they prepared to defend themselves against the Lamanites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,49,21,Alma 49:21,Alma 49:21,"And it came to pass that the captains of the Lamanites brought up their armies before the place of entrance, and began to contend with the Nephites, to get into their place of security; but behold, they were driven back from time to time, insomuch that they were slain with an immense slaughter."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,49,22,Alma 49:22,Alma 49:22,"Now when they found that they could not obtain power over the Nephites by the pass, they began to dig down their banks of earth that they might obtain a pass to their armies, that they might have an equal chance to fight; but behold, in these attempts they were swept off by the stones and arrows which were thrown at them; and instead of filling up their ditches by pulling down the banks of earth, they were filled up in a measure with their dead and wounded bodies."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,49,23,Alma 49:23,Alma 49:23,"Thus the Nephites had all power over their enemies; and thus the Lamanites did attempt to destroy the Nephites until their chief captains were all slain; yea, and more than a thousand of the Lamanites were slain; while, on the other hand, there was not a single soul of the Nephites which was slain."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,49,24,Alma 49:24,Alma 49:24,"There were about fifty who were wounded, who had been exposed to the arrows of the Lamanites through the pass, but they were shielded by their shields, and their breastplates, and their head-plates, insomuch that their wounds were upon their legs, many of which were very severe."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,49,25,Alma 49:25,Alma 49:25,"And it came to pass, that when the Lamanites saw that their chief captains were all slain they fled into the wilderness. And it came to pass that they returned to the land of Nephi, to inform their king, Amalickiah, who was a Nephite by birth, concerning their great loss."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,49,26,Alma 49:26,Alma 49:26,"And it came to pass that he was exceedingly angry with his people, because he had not obtained his desire over the Nephites; he had not subjected them to the yoke of bondage."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,49,27,Alma 49:27,Alma 49:27,"Yea, he was exceedingly wroth, and he did curse God, and also Moroni, swearing with an oath that he would drink his blood; and this because Moroni had kept the commandments of God in preparing for the safety of his people."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,49,28,Alma 49:28,Alma 49:28,"And it came to pass, that on the other hand, the people of Nephi did thank the Lord their God, because of his matchless power in delivering them from the hands of their enemies."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,49,29,Alma 49:29,Alma 49:29,And thus ended the nineteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,49,30,Alma 49:30,Alma 49:30,"Yea, and there was continual peace among them, and exceedingly great prosperity in the church because of their heed and diligence which they gave unto the word of God, which was declared unto them by Helaman, and Shiblon, and Corianton, and Ammon and his brethren, yea, and by all those who had been ordained by the holy order of God, being baptized unto repentance, and sent forth to preach among the people."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,50,1,Alma 50:1,Alma 50:1,"And now it came to pass that Moroni did not stop making preparations for war, or to defend his people against the Lamanites; for he caused that his armies should commence in the commencement of the twentieth year of the reign of the judges, that they should commence in digging up heaps of earth round about all the cities, throughout all the land which was possessed by the Nephites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,50,2,Alma 50:2,Alma 50:2,"And upon the top of these ridges of earth he caused that there should be timbers, yea, works of timbers built up to the height of a man, round about the cities."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,50,3,Alma 50:3,Alma 50:3,And he caused that upon those works of timbers there should be a frame of pickets built upon the timbers round about; and they were strong and high.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,50,4,Alma 50:4,Alma 50:4,"And he caused towers to be erected that overlooked those works of pickets, and he caused places of security to be built upon those towers, that the stones and the arrows of the Lamanites could not hurt them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,50,5,Alma 50:5,Alma 50:5,"And they were prepared that they could cast stones from the top thereof, according to their pleasure and their strength, and slay him who should attempt to approach near the walls of the city."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,50,6,Alma 50:6,Alma 50:6,"Thus Moroni did prepare strongholds against the coming of their enemies, round about every city in all the land."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,50,7,Alma 50:7,Alma 50:7,"And it came to pass that Moroni caused that his armies should go forth into the east wilderness; yea, and they went forth and drove all the Lamanites who were in the east wilderness into their own lands, which were south of the land of Zarahemla."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,50,8,Alma 50:8,Alma 50:8,And the land of Nephi did run in a straight course from the east sea to the west.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,50,9,Alma 50:9,Alma 50:9,"And it came to pass that when Moroni had driven all the Lamanites out of the east wilderness, which was north of the lands of their own possessions, he caused that the inhabitants who were in the land of Zarahemla and in the land round about should go forth into the east wilderness, even to the borders by the seashore, and possess the land."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,50,10,Alma 50:10,Alma 50:10,"And he also placed armies on the south, in the borders of their possessions, and caused them to erect fortifications that they might secure their armies and their people from the hands of their enemies."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,50,11,Alma 50:11,Alma 50:11,"And thus he cut off all the strongholds of the Lamanites in the east wilderness, yea, and also on the west, fortifying the line between the Nephites and the Lamanites, between the land of Zarahemla and the land of Nephi, from the west sea, running by the head of the river Sidon--the Nephites possessing all the land northward, yea, even all the land which was northward of the land Bountiful, according to their pleasure."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,50,12,Alma 50:12,Alma 50:12,"Thus Moroni, with his armies, which did increase daily because of the assurance of protection which his works did bring forth unto them, did seek to cut off the strength and the power of the Lamanites from off the lands of their possessions, that they should have no power upon the lands of their possession."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,50,13,Alma 50:13,Alma 50:13,"And it came to pass that the Nephites began the foundation of a city, and they called the name of the city Moroni; and it was by the east sea; and it was on the south by the line of the possessions of the Lamanites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,50,14,Alma 50:14,Alma 50:14,"And they also began a foundation for a city between the city of Moroni and the city of Aaron, joining the borders of Aaron and Moroni; and they called the name of the city, or the land, Nephihah."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,50,15,Alma 50:15,Alma 50:15,"And they also began in that same year to build many cities on the north, one in a particular manner which they called Lehi, which was in the north by the borders of the seashore."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,50,16,Alma 50:16,Alma 50:16,And thus ended the twentieth year.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,50,17,Alma 50:17,Alma 50:17,And in these prosperous circumstances were the people of Nephi in the commencement of the twenty and first year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,50,19,Alma 50:19,Alma 50:19,"And thus we see how merciful and just are all the dealings of the Lord, to the fulfilling of all his words unto the children of men; yea, we can behold that his words are verified, even at this time, which he spake unto Lehi, saying:"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,50,20,Alma 50:20,Alma 50:20,"Blessed art thou and thy children; and they shall be blessed, inasmuch as they shall keep my commandments they shall prosper in the land. But remember, inasmuch as they will not keep my commandments they shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,50,21,Alma 50:21,Alma 50:21,"And we see that these promises have been verified to the people of Nephi; for it has been their quarrelings and their contentions, yea, their murderings, and their plunderings, their idolatry, their whoredoms, and their abominations, which were among themselves, which brought upon them their wars and their destructions."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,50,22,Alma 50:22,Alma 50:22,"And those who were faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord were delivered at all times, whilst thousands of their wicked brethren have been consigned to bondage, or to perish by the sword, or to dwindle in unbelief, and mingle with the Lamanites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,50,23,Alma 50:23,Alma 50:23,"But behold there never was a happier time among the people of Nephi, since the days of Nephi, than in the days of Moroni, yea, even at this time, in the twenty and first year of the reign of the judges."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,50,24,Alma 50:24,Alma 50:24,"And it came to pass that the twenty and second year of the reign of the judges also ended in peace; yea, and also the twenty and third year."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,50,25,Alma 50:25,Alma 50:25,"And it came to pass that in the commencement of the twenty and fourth year of the reign of the judges, there would also have been peace among the people of Nephi had it not been for a contention which took place among them concerning the land of Lehi, and the land of Morianton, which joined upon the borders of Lehi; both of which were on the borders by the seashore."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,50,26,Alma 50:26,Alma 50:26,"For behold, the people who possessed the land of Morianton did claim a part of the land of Lehi; therefore there began to be a warm contention between them, insomuch that the people of Morianton took up arms against their brethren, and they were determined by the sword to slay them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,50,27,Alma 50:27,Alma 50:27,"But behold, the people who possessed the land of Lehi fled to the camp of Moroni, and appealed unto him for assistance; for behold they were not in the wrong."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,50,28,Alma 50:28,Alma 50:28,"And it came to pass that when the people of Morianton, who were led by a man whose name was Morianton, found that the people of Lehi had fled to the camp of Moroni, they were exceedingly fearful lest the army of Moroni should come upon them and destroy them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,50,29,Alma 50:29,Alma 50:29,"Therefore, Morianton put it into their hearts that they should flee to the land which was northward, which was covered with large bodies of water, and take possession of the land which was northward."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,50,30,Alma 50:30,Alma 50:30,"And behold, they would have carried this plan into effect, (which would have been a cause to have been lamented) but behold, Morianton being a man of much passion, therefore he was angry with one of his maid servants, and he fell upon her and beat her much."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,50,31,Alma 50:31,Alma 50:31,"And it came to pass that she fled, and came over to the camp of Moroni, and told Moroni all things concerning the matter, and also concerning their intentions to flee into the land northward."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,50,32,Alma 50:32,Alma 50:32,"Now behold, the people who were in the land Bountiful, or rather Moroni, feared that they would hearken to the words of Morianton and unite with his people, and thus he would obtain possession of those parts of the land, which would lay a foundation for serious consequences among the people of Nephi, yea, which consequences would lead to the overthrow of their liberty."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,50,33,Alma 50:33,Alma 50:33,"Therefore Moroni sent an army, with their camp, to head the people of Morianton, to stop their flight into the land northward."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,50,34,Alma 50:34,Alma 50:34,"And it came to pass that they did not head them until they had come to the borders of the land Desolation; and there they did head them, by the narrow pass which led by the sea into the land northward, yea, by the sea, on the west and on the east."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,50,35,Alma 50:35,Alma 50:35,"And it came to pass that the army which was sent by Moroni, which was led by a man whose name was Teancum, did meet the people of Morianton; and so stubborn were the people of Morianton, (being inspired by his wickedness and his flattering words) that a battle commenced between them, in the which Teancum did slay Morianton and defeat his army, and took them prisoners, and returned to the camp of Moroni. And thus ended the twenty and fourth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,50,36,Alma 50:36,Alma 50:36,"And thus were the people of Morianton brought back. And upon their covenanting to keep the peace they were restored to the land of Morianton, and a union took place between them and the people of Lehi; and they were also restored to their lands."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,50,37,Alma 50:37,Alma 50:37,"And it came to pass that in the same year that the people of Nephi had peace restored unto them, that Nephihah, the second chief judge, died, having filled the judgment-seat with perfect uprightness before God."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,50,38,Alma 50:38,Alma 50:38,"Nevertheless, he had refused Alma to take possession of those records and those things which were esteemed by Alma and his fathers to be most sacred; therefore Alma had conferred them upon his son, Helaman."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,50,39,Alma 50:39,Alma 50:39,"Behold, it came to pass that the son of Nephihah was appointed to fill the judgment-seat, in the stead of his father; yea, he was appointed chief judge and governor over the people, with an oath and sacred ordinance to judge righteously, and to keep the peace and the freedom of the people, and to grant unto them their sacred privileges to worship the Lord their God, yea, to support and maintain the cause of God all his days, and to bring the wicked to justice according to their crime."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,50,40,Alma 50:40,Alma 50:40,"Now behold, his name was Pahoran. And Pahoran did fill the seat of his father, and did commence his reign in the end of the twenty and fourth year, over the people of Nephi."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,51,2,Alma 51:2,Alma 51:2,"Nevertheless, they did not long maintain an entire peace in the land, for there began to be a contention among the people concerning the chief judge Pahoran; for behold, there were a part of the people who desired that a few particular points of the law should be altered."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,51,3,Alma 51:3,Alma 51:3,"But behold, Pahoran would not alter nor suffer the law to be altered; therefore, he did not hearken to those who had sent in their voices with their petitions concerning the altering of the law."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,51,4,Alma 51:4,Alma 51:4,"Therefore, those who were desirous that the law should be altered were angry with him, and desired that he should no longer be chief judge over the land; therefore there arose a warm dispute concerning the matter, but not unto bloodshed."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,51,5,Alma 51:5,Alma 51:5,"And it came to pass that those who were desirous that Pahoran should be dethroned from the judgment-seat were called king-men, for they were desirous that the law should be altered in a manner to overthrow the free government and to establish a king over the land."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,51,6,Alma 51:6,Alma 51:6,"And those who were desirous that Pahoran should remain chief judge over the land took upon them the name of freemen; and thus was the division among them, for the freemen had sworn or covenanted to maintain their rights and the privileges of their religion by a free government."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,51,7,Alma 51:7,Alma 51:7,"And it came to pass that this matter of their contention was settled by the voice of the people. And it came to pass that the voice of the people came in favor of the freemen, and Pahoran retained the judgment-seat, which caused much rejoicing among the brethren of Pahoran and also many of the people of liberty, who also put the king-men to silence, that they durst not oppose but were obliged to maintain the cause of freedom."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,51,8,Alma 51:8,Alma 51:8,"Now those who were in favor of kings were those of high birth, and they sought to be kings; and they were supported by those who sought power and authority over the people."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,51,9,Alma 51:9,Alma 51:9,"But behold, this was a critical time for such contentions to be among the people of Nephi; for behold, Amalickiah had again stirred up the hearts of the people of the Lamanites against the people of the Nephites, and he was gathering together soldiers from all parts of his land, and arming them, and preparing for war with all diligence; for he had sworn to drink the blood of Moroni."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,51,10,Alma 51:10,Alma 51:10,"But behold, we shall see that his promise which he made was rash; nevertheless, he did prepare himself and his armies to come to battle against the Nephites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,51,11,Alma 51:11,Alma 51:11,"Now his armies were not so great as they had hitherto been, because of the many thousands who had been slain by the hand of the Nephites; but notwithstanding their great loss, Amalickiah had gathered together a wonderfully great army, insomuch that he feared not to come down to the land of Zarahemla."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,51,12,Alma 51:12,Alma 51:12,"Yea, even Amalickiah did himself come down, at the head of the Lamanites. And it was in the twenty and fifth year of the reign of the judges; and it was at the same time that they had begun to settle the affairs of their contentions concerning the chief judge, Pahoran."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,51,13,Alma 51:13,Alma 51:13,"And it came to pass that when the men who were called king-men had heard that the Lamanites were coming down to battle against them, they were glad in their hearts; and they refused to take up arms, for they were so wroth with the chief judge, and also with the people of liberty, that they would not take up arms to defend their country."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,51,14,Alma 51:14,Alma 51:14,"And it came to pass that when Moroni saw this, and also saw that the Lamanites were coming into the borders of the land, he was exceedingly wroth because of the stubbornness of those people whom he had labored with so much diligence to preserve; yea, he was exceedingly wroth; his soul was filled with anger against them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,51,15,Alma 51:15,Alma 51:15,"And it came to pass that he sent a petition, with the voice of the people, unto the governor of the land, desiring that he should read it, and give him (Moroni) power to compel those dissenters to defend their country or to put them to death."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,51,16,Alma 51:16,Alma 51:16,"For it was his first care to put an end to such contentions and dissensions among the people; for behold, this had been hitherto a cause of all their destruction. And it came to pass that it was granted according to the voice of the people."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,51,17,Alma 51:17,Alma 51:17,"And it came to pass that Moroni commanded that his army should go against those king-men, to pull down their pride and their nobility and level them with the earth, or they should take up arms and support the cause of liberty."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,51,18,Alma 51:18,Alma 51:18,"And it came to pass that the armies did march forth against them; and they did pull down their pride and their nobility, insomuch that as they did lift their weapons of war to fight against the men of Moroni they were hewn down and leveled to the earth."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,51,19,Alma 51:19,Alma 51:19,"And it came to pass that there were four thousand of those dissenters who were hewn down by the sword; and those of their leaders who were not slain in battle were taken and cast into prison, for there was no time for their trials at this period."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,51,20,Alma 51:20,Alma 51:20,"And the remainder of those dissenters, rather than be smitten down to the earth by the sword, yielded to the standard of liberty, and were compelled to hoist the title of liberty upon their towers, and in their cities, and to take up arms in defence of their country."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,51,21,Alma 51:21,Alma 51:21,"And thus Moroni put an end to those king-men, that there were not any known by the appellation of king-men; and thus he put an end to the stubbornness and the pride of those people who professed the blood of nobility; but they were brought down to humble themselves like unto their brethren, and to fight valiantly for their freedom from bondage."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,51,22,Alma 51:22,Alma 51:22,"Behold, it came to pass that while Moroni was thus breaking down the wars and contentions among his own people, and subjecting them to peace and civilization, and making regulations to prepare for war against the Lamanites, behold, the Lamanites had come into the land of Moroni, which was in the borders by the seashore."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,51,23,Alma 51:23,Alma 51:23,"And it came to pass that the Nephites were not sufficiently strong in the city of Moroni; therefore Amalickiah did drive them, slaying many.

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,51,24,Alma 51:24,Alma 51:24,"And those who fled out of the city of Moroni came to the city of Nephihah; and also the people of the city of Lehi gathered themselves together, and made preparations and were ready to receive the Lamanites to battle."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,51,25,Alma 51:25,Alma 51:25,"But it came to pass that Amalickiah would not suffer the Lamanites to go against the city of Nephihah to battle, but kept them down by the seashore, leaving men in every city to maintain and defend it."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,51,26,Alma 51:26,Alma 51:26,"And thus he went on, taking possession of many cities, the city of Nephihah, and the city of Lehi, and the city of Morianton, and the city of Omner, and the city of Gid, and the city of Mulek, all of which were on the east borders by the seashore."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,51,27,Alma 51:27,Alma 51:27,"And thus had the Lamanites obtained, by the cunning of Amalickiah, so many cities, by their numberless hosts, all of which were strongly fortified after the manner of the fortifications of Moroni; all of which afforded strongholds for the Lamanites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,51,28,Alma 51:28,Alma 51:28,"And it came to pass that they marched to the borders of the land Bountiful, driving the Nephites before them and slaying many."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,51,30,Alma 51:30,Alma 51:30,"And it came to pass that he headed Amalickiah also, as he was marching forth with his numerous army that he might take possession of the land Bountiful, and also the land northward."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,51,31,Alma 51:31,Alma 51:31,"But behold he met with a disappointment by being repulsed by Teancum and his men, for they were great warriors; for every man of Teancum did exceed the Lamanites in their strength and in their skill of war, insomuch that they did gain advantage over the Lamanites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,51,32,Alma 51:32,Alma 51:32,"And it came to pass that they did harass them, insomuch that they did slay them even until it was dark. And it came to pass that Teancum and his men did pitch their tents in the borders of the land Bountiful; and Amalickiah did pitch his tents in the borders on the beach by the seashore, and after this manner were they driven."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,51,33,Alma 51:33,Alma 51:33,"And it came to pass that when the night had come, Teancum and his servant stole forth and went out by night, and went into the camp of Amalickiah; and behold, sleep had overpowered them because of their much fatigue, which was caused by the labors and heat of the day."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,51,34,Alma 51:34,Alma 51:34,"And it came to pass that Teancum stole privily into the tent of the king, and put a javelin to his heart; and he did cause the death of the king immediately that he did not awake his servants."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,51,35,Alma 51:35,Alma 51:35,"And he returned again privily to his own camp, and behold, his men were asleep, and he awoke them and told them all the things that he had done."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,51,36,Alma 51:36,Alma 51:36,"And he caused that his armies should stand in readiness, lest the Lamanites had awakened and should come upon them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,51,37,Alma 51:37,Alma 51:37,And thus endeth the twenty and fifth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi; and thus endeth the days of Amalickiah.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,52,1,Alma 52:1,Alma 52:1,"And now, it came to pass in the twenty and sixth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, behold, when the Lamanites awoke on the first morning of the first month, behold, they found Amalickiah was dead in his own tent; and they also saw that Teancum was ready to give them battle on that day."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,52,2,Alma 52:2,Alma 52:2,"And now, when the Lamanites saw this they were affrighted; and they abandoned their design in marching into the land northward, and retreated with all their army into the city of Mulek, and sought protection in their fortifications."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,52,3,Alma 52:3,Alma 52:3,"And it came to pass that the brother of Amalickiah was appointed king over the people; and his name was Ammoron; thus king Ammoron, the brother of king Amalickiah, was appointed to reign in his stead."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,52,4,Alma 52:4,Alma 52:4,"And it came to pass that he did command that his people should maintain those cities, which they had taken by the shedding of blood; for they had not taken any cities save they had lost much blood."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,52,5,Alma 52:5,Alma 52:5,"And now, Teancum saw that the Lamanites were determined to maintain those cities which they had taken, and those parts of the land which they had obtained possession of; and also seeing the enormity of their number, Teancum thought it was not expedient that he should attempt to attack them in their forts."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,52,6,Alma 52:6,Alma 52:6,"But he kept his men round about, as if making preparations for war; yea, and truly he was preparing to defend himself against them, by casting up walls round about and preparing places of resort."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,52,7,Alma 52:7,Alma 52:7,And it came to pass that he kept thus preparing for war until Moroni had sent a large number of men to strengthen his army.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,52,8,Alma 52:8,Alma 52:8,"And Moroni also sent orders unto him that he should retain all the prisoners who fell into his hands; for as the Lamanites had taken many prisoners, that he should retain all the prisoners of the Lamanites as a ransom for those whom the Lamanites had taken."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,52,9,Alma 52:9,Alma 52:9,"And he also sent orders unto him that he should fortify the land Bountiful, and secure the narrow pass which led into the land northward, lest the Lamanites should obtain that point and should have power to harass them on every side."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,52,10,Alma 52:10,Alma 52:10,"And Moroni also sent unto him, desiring him that he would be faithful in maintaining that quarter of the land, and that he would seek every opportunity to scourge the Lamanites in that quarter, as much as was in his power, that perhaps he might take again by stratagem or some other way those cities which had been taken out of their hands; and that he also would fortify and strengthen the cities round about, which had not fallen into the hands of the Lamanites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,52,11,Alma 52:11,Alma 52:11,"And he also said unto him, I would come unto you, but behold, the Lamanites are upon us in the borders of the land by the west sea; and behold, I go against them, therefore I cannot come unto you."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,52,12,Alma 52:12,Alma 52:12,"Now, the king (Ammoron) had departed out of the land of Zarahemla, and had made known unto the queen concerning the death of his brother, and had gathered together a large number of men, and had marched forth against the Nephites on the borders by the west sea."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,52,13,Alma 52:13,Alma 52:13,"And thus he was endeavoring to harass the Nephites, and to draw away a part of their forces to that part of the land, while he had commanded those whom he had left to possess the cities which he had taken, that they should also harass the Nephites on the borders by the east sea, and should take possession of their lands as much as it was in their power, according to the power of their armies."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,52,14,Alma 52:14,Alma 52:14,And thus were the Nephites in those dangerous circumstances in the ending of the twenty and sixth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,52,15,Alma 52:15,Alma 52:15,"But behold, it came to pass in the twenty and seventh year of the reign of the judges, that Teancum, by the command of Moroni--who had established armies to protect the south and the west borders of the land, and had begun his march towards the land Bountiful, that he might assist Teancum with his men in retaking the cities which they had lost--"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,52,16,Alma 52:16,Alma 52:16,"And it came to pass that Teancum had received orders to make an attack upon the city of Mulek, and retake it if it were possible."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,52,17,Alma 52:17,Alma 52:17,"And it came to pass that Teancum made preparations to make an attack upon the city of Mulek, and march forth with his army against the Lamanites; but he saw that it was impossible that he could overpower them while they were in their fortifications; therefore he abandoned his designs and returned again to the city Bountiful, to wait for the coming of Moroni, that he might receive strength to his army."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,52,18,Alma 52:18,Alma 52:18,"And it came to pass that Moroni did arrive with his army at the land of Bountiful, in the latter end of the twenty and seventh year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,52,19,Alma 52:19,Alma 52:19,"And in the commencement of the twenty and eighth year, Moroni and Teancum and many of the chief captains held a council of war--what they should do to cause the Lamanites to come out against them to battle; or that they might by some means flatter them out of their strongholds, that they might gain advantage over them and take again the city of Mulek."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,52,20,Alma 52:20,Alma 52:20,"And it came to pass they sent embassies to the army of the Lamanites, which protected the city of Mulek, to their leader, whose name was Jacob, desiring him that he would come out with his armies to meet them upon the plains between the two cities. But behold, Jacob, who was a Zoramite, would not come out with his army to meet them upon the plains."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,52,21,Alma 52:21,Alma 52:21,"And it came to pass that Moroni, having no hopes of meeting them upon fair grounds, therefore, he resolved upon a plan that he might decoy the Lamanites out of their strongholds."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,52,22,Alma 52:22,Alma 52:22,"Therefore he caused that Teancum should take a small number of men and march down near the seashore; and Moroni and his army, by night, marched in the wilderness, on the west of the city Mulek; and thus, on the morrow, when the guards of the Lamanites had discovered Teancum, they ran and told it unto Jacob, their leader."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,52,23,Alma 52:23,Alma 52:23,"And it came to pass that the armies of the Lamanites did march forth against Teancum, supposing by their numbers to overpower Teancum because of the smallness of his numbers. And as Teancum saw the armies of the Lamanites coming out against him he began to retreat down by the seashore, northward."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,52,24,Alma 52:24,Alma 52:24,"And it came to pass that when the Lamanites saw that he began to flee, they took courage and pursued them with vigor. And while Teancum was thus leading away the Lamanites who were pursuing them in vain, behold, Moroni commanded that a part of his army who were with him should march forth into the city, and take possession of it."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,52,25,Alma 52:25,Alma 52:25,"And thus they did, and slew all those who had been left to protect the city, yea, all those who would not yield up their weapons of war."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,52,26,Alma 52:26,Alma 52:26,"And thus Moroni had obtained possession of the city Mulek with a part of his army, while he marched with the remainder to meet the Lamanites when they should return from the pursuit of Teancum."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,52,27,Alma 52:27,Alma 52:27,"And it came to pass that the Lamanites did pursue Teancum until they came near the city Bountiful, and then they were met by Lehi and a small army, which had been left to protect the city Bountiful."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,52,28,Alma 52:28,Alma 52:28,"And now behold, when the chief captains of the Lamanites had beheld Lehi with his army coming against them, they fled in much confusion, lest perhaps they should not obtain the city Mulek before Lehi should overtake them; for they were wearied because of their march, and the men of Lehi were fresh."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,52,29,Alma 52:29,Alma 52:29,Now the Lamanites did not know that Moroni had been in their rear with his army; and all they feared was Lehi and his men.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,52,30,Alma 52:30,Alma 52:30,Now Lehi was not desirous to overtake them till they should meet Moroni and his army.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,52,31,Alma 52:31,Alma 52:31,"And it came to pass that before the Lamanites had retreated far they were surrounded by the Nephites, by the men of Moroni on one hand, and the men of Lehi on the other, all of whom were fresh and full of strength; but the Lamanites were wearied because of their long march."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,52,32,Alma 52:32,Alma 52:32,And Moroni commanded his men that they should fall upon them until they had given up their weapons of war.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,52,33,Alma 52:33,Alma 52:33,"And it came to pass that Jacob, being their leader, being also a Zoramite, and having an unconquerable spirit, he led the Lamanites forth to battle with exceeding fury against Moroni."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,52,34,Alma 52:34,Alma 52:34,"Moroni being in their course of march, therefore Jacob was determined to slay them and cut his way through to the city of Mulek. But behold, Moroni and his men were more powerful; therefore they did not give way before the Lamanites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,52,35,Alma 52:35,Alma 52:35,"And it came to pass that they fought on both hands with exceeding fury; and there were many slain on both sides; yea, and Moroni was wounded and Jacob was killed."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,52,36,Alma 52:36,Alma 52:36,"And Lehi pressed upon their rear with such fury with his strong men, that the Lamanites in the rear delivered up their weapons of war; and the remainder of them, being much confused, knew not whither to go or to strike."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,52,37,Alma 52:37,Alma 52:37,"Now Moroni seeing their confusion, he said unto them: If ye will bring forth your weapons of war and deliver them up, behold we will forbear shedding your blood."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,52,38,Alma 52:38,Alma 52:38,"And it came to pass that when the Lamanites had heard these words, their chief captains, all those who were not slain, came forth and threw down their weapons of war at the feet of Moroni, and also commanded their men that they should do the same."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,52,39,Alma 52:39,Alma 52:39,"But behold, there were many that would not; and those who would not deliver up their swords were taken and bound, and their weapons of war were taken from them, and they were compelled to march with their brethren forth into the land Bountiful."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,52,40,Alma 52:40,Alma 52:40,"And now the number of prisoners who were taken exceeded more than the number of those who had been slain, yea, more than those who had been slain on both sides."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,53,1,Alma 53:1,Alma 53:1,"And it came to pass that they did set guards over the prisoners of the Lamanites, and did compel them to go forth and bury their dead, yea, and also the dead of the Nephites who were slain; and Moroni placed men over them to guard them while they should perform their labors."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,53,2,Alma 53:2,Alma 53:2,"And Moroni went to the city of Mulek with Lehi, and took command of the city and gave it unto Lehi. Now behold, this Lehi was a man who had been with Moroni in the more part of all his battles; and he was a man like unto Moroni, and they rejoiced in each other's safety; yea, they were beloved by each other, and also beloved by all the people of Nephi."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,53,3,Alma 53:3,Alma 53:3,"And it came to pass that after the Lamanites had finished burying their dead and also the dead of the Nephites, they were marched back into the land Bountiful; and Teancum, by the orders of Moroni, caused that they should commence laboring in digging a ditch round about the land, or the city, Bountiful."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,53,4,Alma 53:4,Alma 53:4,"And he caused that they should build a breastwork of timbers upon the inner bank of the ditch; and they cast up dirt out of the ditch against the breastwork of timbers; and thus they did cause the Lamanites to labor until they had encircled the city of Bountiful round about with a strong wall of timbers and earth, to an exceeding height."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,53,5,Alma 53:5,Alma 53:5,"And this city became an exceeding stronghold ever after; and in this city they did guard the prisoners of the Lamanites; yea, even within a wall which they had caused them to build with their own hands. Now Moroni was compelled to cause the Lamanites to labor, because it was easy to guard them while at their labor; and he desired all his forces when he should make an attack upon the Lamanites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,53,6,Alma 53:6,Alma 53:6,"And it came to pass that Moroni had thus gained a victory over one of the greatest of the armies of the Lamanites, and had obtained possession of the city of Mulek, which was one of the strongest holds of the Lamanites in the land of Nephi; and thus he had also built a stronghold to retain his prisoners."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,53,7,Alma 53:7,Alma 53:7,"And it came to pass that he did no more attempt a battle with the Lamanites in that year, but he did employ his men in preparing for war, yea, and in making fortifications to guard against the Lamanites, yea, and also delivering their women and their children from famine and affliction, and providing food for their armies."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,53,8,Alma 53:8,Alma 53:8,"And now it came to pass that the armies of the Lamanites, on the west sea, south, while in the absence of Moroni on account of some intrigue amongst the Nephites, which caused dissensions amongst them, had gained some ground over the Nephites, yea, insomuch that they had obtained possession of a number of their cities in that part of the land."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,53,9,Alma 53:9,Alma 53:9,"And thus because of iniquity amongst themselves, yea, because of dissensions and intrigue among themselves they were placed in the most dangerous circumstances."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,53,10,Alma 53:10,Alma 53:10,"And now behold, I have somewhat to say concerning the people of Ammon, who, in the beginning, were Lamanites; but by Ammon and his brethren, or rather by the power and word of God, they had been converted unto the Lord; and they had been brought down into the land of Zarahemla, and had ever since been protected by the Nephites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,53,11,Alma 53:11,Alma 53:11,"And because of their oath they had been kept from taking up arms against their brethren; for they had taken an oath that they never would shed blood more; and according to their oath they would have perished; yea, they would have suffered themselves to have fallen into the hands of their brethren, had it not been for the pity and the exceeding love which Ammon and his brethren had had for them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,53,12,Alma 53:12,Alma 53:12,And for this cause they were brought down into the land of Zarahemla; and they ever had been protected by the Nephites.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,53,13,Alma 53:13,Alma 53:13,"But it came to pass that when they saw the danger, and the many afflictions and tribulations which the Nephites bore for them, they were moved with compassion and were desirous to take up arms in the defence of their country."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,53,14,Alma 53:14,Alma 53:14,"But behold, as they were about to take their weapons of war, they were overpowered by the persuasions of Helaman and his brethren, for they were about to break the oath which they had made."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,53,15,Alma 53:15,Alma 53:15,"And Helaman feared lest by so doing they should lose their souls; therefore all those who had entered into this covenant were compelled to behold their brethren wade through their afflictions, in their dangerous circumstances at this time."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,53,16,Alma 53:16,Alma 53:16,"But behold, it came to pass they had many sons, who had not entered into a covenant that they would not take their weapons of war to defend themselves against their enemies; therefore they did assemble themselves together at this time, as many as were able to take up arms, and they called themselves Nephites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,53,17,Alma 53:17,Alma 53:17,"And they entered into a covenant to fight for the liberty of the Nephites, yea, to protect the land unto the laying down of their lives; yea, even they covenanted that they never would give up their liberty, but they would fight in all cases to protect the Nephites and themselves from bondage."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,53,18,Alma 53:18,Alma 53:18,"Now behold, there were two thousand of those young men, who entered into this covenant and took their weapons of war to defend their country."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,53,19,Alma 53:19,Alma 53:19,"And now behold, as they never had hitherto been a disadvantage to the Nephites, they became now at this period of time also a great support; for they took their weapons of war, and they would that Helaman should be their leader."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,53,20,Alma 53:20,Alma 53:20,"And they were all young men, and they were exceedingly valiant for courage, and also for strength and activity; but behold, this was not all--they were men who were true at all times in whatsoever thing they were entrusted."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,53,21,Alma 53:21,Alma 53:21,"Yea, they were men of truth and soberness, for they had been taught to keep the commandments of God and to walk uprightly before him."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,53,22,Alma 53:22,Alma 53:22,"And now it came to pass that Helaman did march at the head of his two thousand stripling soldiers, to the support of the people in the borders of the land on the south by the west sea."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,53,23,Alma 53:23,Alma 53:23,And thus ended the twenty and eighth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,54,1,Alma 54:1,Alma 54:1,"And now it came to pass in the commencement of the twenty and ninth year of the judges, that Ammoron sent unto Moroni desiring that he would exchange prisoners."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,54,2,Alma 54:2,Alma 54:2,"And it came to pass that Moroni felt to rejoice exceedingly at this request, for he desired the provisions which were imparted for the support of the Lamanite prisoners for the support of his own people; and he also desired his own people for the strengthening of his army."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,54,3,Alma 54:3,Alma 54:3,"Now the Lamanites had taken many women and children, and there was not a woman nor a child among all the prisoners of Moroni, or the prisoners whom Moroni had taken; therefore Moroni resolved upon a stratagem to obtain as many prisoners of the Nephites from the Lamanites as it were possible."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,54,4,Alma 54:4,Alma 54:4,"Therefore he wrote an epistle, and sent it by the servant of Ammoron, the same who had brought an epistle to Moroni. Now these are the words which he wrote unto Ammoron, saying:"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,54,5,Alma 54:5,Alma 54:5,"Behold, Ammoron, I have written unto you somewhat concerning this war which ye have waged against my people, or rather which thy brother hath waged against them, and which ye are still determined to carry on after his death."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,54,6,Alma 54:6,Alma 54:6,"Behold, I would tell you somewhat concerning the justice of God, and the sword of his almighty wrath, which doth hang over you except ye repent and withdraw your armies into your own lands, or the land of your possessions, which is the land of Nephi."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,54,7,Alma 54:7,Alma 54:7,"Yea, I would tell you these things if ye were capable of hearkening unto them; yea, I would tell you concerning that awful hell that awaits to receive such murderers as thou and thy brother have been, except ye repent and withdraw your murderous purposes, and return with your armies to your own lands."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,54,8,Alma 54:8,Alma 54:8,"But as ye have once rejected these things, and have fought against the people of the Lord, even so I may expect you will do it again."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,54,9,Alma 54:9,Alma 54:9,"And now behold, we are prepared to receive you; yea, and except you withdraw your purposes, behold, ye will pull down the wrath of that God whom you have rejected upon you, even to your utter destruction."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,54,10,Alma 54:10,Alma 54:10,"But, as the Lord liveth, our armies shall come upon you except ye withdraw, and ye shall soon be visited with death, for we will retain our cities and our lands; yea, and we will maintain our religion and the cause of our God."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,54,11,Alma 54:11,Alma 54:11,"But behold, it supposeth me that I talk to you concerning these things in vain; or it supposeth me that thou art a child of hell; therefore I will close my epistle by telling you that I will not exchange prisoners, save it be on conditions that ye will deliver up a man and his wife and his children, for one prisoner; if this be the case that ye will do it, I will exchange."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,54,12,Alma 54:12,Alma 54:12,"And behold, if ye do not this, I will come against you with my armies; yea, even I will arm my women and my children, and I will come against you, and I will follow you even into your own land, which is the land of our first inheritance; yea, and it shall be blood for blood, yea, life for life; and I will give you battle even until you are destroyed from off the face of the earth."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,54,13,Alma 54:13,Alma 54:13,"Behold, I am in my anger, and also my people; ye have sought to murder us, and we have only sought to defend ourselves. But behold, if ye seek to destroy us more we will seek to destroy you; yea, and we will seek our land, the land of our first inheritance."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,54,14,Alma 54:14,Alma 54:14,Now I close my epistle. I am Moroni; I am a leader of the people of the Nephites.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,54,15,Alma 54:15,Alma 54:15,"Now it came to pass that Ammoron, when he had received this epistle, was angry; and he wrote another epistle unto Moroni, and these are the words which he wrote, saying:"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,54,16,Alma 54:16,Alma 54:16,"I am Ammoron, the king of the Lamanites; I am the brother of Amalickiah whom ye have murdered. Behold, I will avenge his blood upon you, yea, and I will come upon you with my armies for I fear not your threatenings."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,54,17,Alma 54:17,Alma 54:17,"For behold, your fathers did wrong their brethren, insomuch that they did rob them of their right to the government when it rightly belonged unto them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,54,18,Alma 54:18,Alma 54:18,"And now behold, if ye will lay down your arms, and subject yourselves to be governed by those to whom the government doth rightly belong, then will I cause that my people shall lay down their weapons and shall be at war no more."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,54,19,Alma 54:19,Alma 54:19,"Behold, ye have breathed out many threatenings against me and my people; but behold, we fear not your threatenings."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,54,20,Alma 54:20,Alma 54:20,"Nevertheless, I will grant to exchange prisoners according to your request, gladly, that I may preserve my food for my men of war; and we will wage a war which shall be eternal, either to the subjecting the Nephites to our authority or to their eternal extinction."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,54,21,Alma 54:21,Alma 54:21,"And as concerning that God whom ye say we have rejected, behold, we know not such a being; neither do ye; but if it so be that there is such a being, we know not but that he hath made us as well as you."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,54,22,Alma 54:22,Alma 54:22,"And if it so be that there is a devil and a hell, behold will he not send you there to dwell with my brother whom ye have murdered, whom ye have hinted that he hath gone to such a place? But behold these things matter not."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,54,23,Alma 54:23,Alma 54:23,"I am Ammoron, and a descendant of Zoram, whom your fathers pressed and brought out of Jerusalem."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,54,24,Alma 54:24,Alma 54:24,"And behold now, I am a bold Lamanite; behold, this war hath been waged to avenge their wrongs, and to maintain and to obtain their rights to the government; and I close my epistle to Moroni."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,55,1,Alma 55:1,Alma 55:1,"Now it came to pass that when Moroni had received this epistle he was more angry, because he knew that Ammoron had a perfect knowledge of his fraud; yea, he knew that Ammoron knew that it was not a just cause that had caused him to wage a war against the people of Nephi."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,55,2,Alma 55:2,Alma 55:2,"And he said: Behold, I will not exchange prisoners with Ammoron save he will withdraw his purpose, as I have stated in my epistle; for I will not grant unto him that he shall have any more power than what he hath got."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,55,3,Alma 55:3,Alma 55:3,"Behold, I know the place where the Lamanites do guard my people whom they have taken prisoners; and as Ammoron would not grant unto me mine epistle, behold, I will give unto him according to my words; yea, I will seek death among them until they shall sue for peace."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,55,4,Alma 55:4,Alma 55:4,"And now it came to pass that when Moroni had said these words, he caused that a search should be made among his men, that perhaps he might find a man who was a descendant of Laman among them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,55,5,Alma 55:5,Alma 55:5,"And it came to pass that they found one, whose name was Laman; and he was one of the servants of the king who was murdered by Amalickiah."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,55,6,Alma 55:6,Alma 55:6,Now Moroni caused that Laman and a small number of his men should go forth unto the guards who were over the Nephites.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,55,7,Alma 55:7,Alma 55:7,Now the Nephites were guarded in the city of Gid; therefore Moroni appointed Laman and caused that a small number of men should go with him.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,55,8,Alma 55:8,Alma 55:8,"And when it was evening Laman went to the guards who were over the Nephites, and behold, they saw him coming and they hailed him; but he saith unto them: Fear not; behold, I am a Lamanite. Behold, we have escaped from the Nephites, and they sleep; and behold we have taken of their wine and brought with us."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,55,9,Alma 55:9,Alma 55:9,"Now when the Lamanites heard these words they received him with joy; and they said unto him: Give us of your wine, that we may drink; we are glad that ye have thus taken wine with you for we are weary."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,55,10,Alma 55:10,Alma 55:10,But Laman said unto them: Let us keep of our wine till we go against the Nephites to battle. But this saying only made them more desirous to drink of the wine;
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,55,11,Alma 55:11,Alma 55:11,"For, said they: We are weary, therefore let us take of the wine, and by and by we shall receive wine for our rations, which will strengthen us to go against the Nephites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,55,12,Alma 55:12,Alma 55:12,And Laman said unto them: You may do according to your desires.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,55,13,Alma 55:13,Alma 55:13,"And it came to pass that they did take of the wine freely; and it was pleasant to their taste, therefore they took of it more freely; and it was strong, having been prepared in its strength."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,55,14,Alma 55:14,Alma 55:14,"And it came to pass they did drink and were merry, and by and by they were all drunken."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,55,15,Alma 55:15,Alma 55:15,"And now when Laman and his men saw that they were all drunken, and were in a deep sleep, they returned to Moroni and told him all the things that had happened."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,55,16,Alma 55:16,Alma 55:16,"And now this was according to the design of Moroni. And Moroni had prepared his men with weapons of war; and he went to the city Gid, while the Lamanites were in a deep sleep and drunken, and cast in weapons of war unto the prisoners, insomuch that they were all armed;"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,55,17,Alma 55:17,Alma 55:17,"Yea, even to their women, and all those of their children, as many as were able to use a weapon of war, when Moroni had armed all those prisoners; and all those things were done in a profound silence."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,55,18,Alma 55:18,Alma 55:18,"But had they awakened the Lamanites, behold they were drunken and the Nephites could have slain them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,55,19,Alma 55:19,Alma 55:19,"But behold, this was not the desire of Moroni; he did not delight in murder or bloodshed, but he delighted in the saving of his people from destruction; and for this cause he might not bring upon him injustice, he would not fall upon the Lamanites and destroy them in their drunkenness."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,55,20,Alma 55:20,Alma 55:20,"But he had obtained his desires; for he had armed those prisoners of the Nephites who were within the wall of the city, and had given them power to gain possession of those parts which were within the walls."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,55,21,Alma 55:21,Alma 55:21,"And then he caused the men who were with him to withdraw a pace from them, and surround the armies of the Lamanites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,55,22,Alma 55:22,Alma 55:22,"Now behold this was done in the night-time, so that when the Lamanites awoke in the morning they beheld that they were surrounded by the Nephites without, and that their prisoners were armed within."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,55,23,Alma 55:23,Alma 55:23,"And thus they saw that the Nephites had power over them; and in these circumstances they found that it was not expedient that they should fight with the Nephites; therefore their chief captains demanded their weapons of war, and they brought them forth and cast them at the feet of the Nephites, pleading for mercy."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,55,24,Alma 55:24,Alma 55:24,"Now behold, this was the desire of Moroni. He took them prisoners of war, and took possession of the city, and caused that all the prisoners should be liberated, who were Nephites; and they did join the army of Moroni, and were a great strength to his army."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,55,25,Alma 55:25,Alma 55:25,"And it came to pass that he did cause the Lamanites, whom he had taken prisoners, that they should commence a labor in strengthening the fortifications round about the city Gid."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,55,26,Alma 55:26,Alma 55:26,"And it came to pass that when he had fortified the city Gid, according to his desires, he caused that his prisoners should be taken to the city Bountiful; and he also guarded that city with an exceedingly strong force."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,55,27,Alma 55:27,Alma 55:27,"And it came to pass that they did, notwithstanding all the intrigues of the Lamanites, keep and protect all the prisoners whom they had taken, and also maintain all the ground and the advantage which they had retaken."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,55,28,Alma 55:28,Alma 55:28,"And it came to pass that the Nephites began again to be victorious, and to reclaim their rights and their privileges."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,55,29,Alma 55:29,Alma 55:29,"Many times did the Lamanites attempt to encircle them about by night, but in these attempts they did lose many prisoners."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,55,30,Alma 55:30,Alma 55:30,"And many times did they attempt to administer of their wine to the Nephites, that they might destroy them with poison or with drunkenness."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,55,31,Alma 55:31,Alma 55:31,"But behold, the Nephites were not slow to remember the Lord their God in this their time of affliction. They could not be taken in their snares; yea, they would not partake of their wine, save they had first given to some of the Lamanite prisoners."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,55,32,Alma 55:32,Alma 55:32,And they were thus cautious that no poison should be administered among them; for if their wine would poison a Lamanite it would also poison a Nephite; and thus they did try all their liquors.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,55,33,Alma 55:33,Alma 55:33,"And now it came to pass that it was expedient for Moroni to make preparations to attack the city Morianton; for behold, the Lamanites had, by their labors, fortified the city Morianton until it had become an exceeding stronghold."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,55,34,Alma 55:34,Alma 55:34,"And they were continually bringing new forces into that city, and also new supplies of provisions."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,55,35,Alma 55:35,Alma 55:35,And thus ended the twenty and ninth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,1,Alma 56:1,Alma 56:1,"And now it came to pass in the commencement of the thirtieth year of the reign of the judges, on the second day in the first month, Moroni received an epistle from Helaman, stating the affairs of the people in that quarter of the land."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,2,Alma 56:2,Alma 56:2,"And these are the words which he wrote, saying: My dearly beloved brother, Moroni, as well in the Lord as in the tribulations of our warfare; behold, my beloved brother, I have somewhat to tell you concerning our warfare in this part of the land."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,3,Alma 56:3,Alma 56:3,"Behold, two thousand of the sons of those men whom Ammon brought down out of the land of Nephi--now ye have known that these were descendants of Laman, who was the eldest son of our father Lehi;"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,4,Alma 56:4,Alma 56:4,"Now I need not rehearse unto you concerning their traditions or their unbelief, for thou knowest concerning all these things--"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,5,Alma 56:5,Alma 56:5,"Therefore it sufficeth me that I tell you that two thousand of these young men have taken their weapons of war, and would that I should be their leader; and we have come forth to defend our country."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,6,Alma 56:6,Alma 56:6,"And now ye also know concerning the covenant which their fathers made, that they would not take up their weapons of war against their brethren to shed blood."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,7,Alma 56:7,Alma 56:7,"But in the twenty and sixth year, when they saw our afflictions and our tribulations for them, they were about to break the covenant which they had made and take up their weapons of war in our defence."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,8,Alma 56:8,Alma 56:8,"But I would not suffer them that they should break this covenant which they had made, supposing that God would strengthen us, insomuch that we should not suffer more because of the fulfilling the oath which they had taken."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,9,Alma 56:9,Alma 56:9,"But behold, here is one thing in which we may have great joy. For behold, in the twenty and sixth year, I, Helaman, did march at the head of these two thousand young men to the city of Judea, to assist Antipus, whom ye had appointed a leader over the people of that part of the land."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,10,Alma 56:10,Alma 56:10,"And I did join my two thousand sons, (for they are worthy to be called sons) to the army of Antipus, in which strength Antipus did rejoice exceedingly; for behold, his army had been reduced by the Lamanites because their forces had slain a vast number of our men, for which cause we have to mourn."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,11,Alma 56:11,Alma 56:11,"Nevertheless, we may console ourselves in this point, that they have died in the cause of their country and of their God, yea, and they are happy."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,12,Alma 56:12,Alma 56:12,"And the Lamanites had also retained many prisoners, all of whom are chief captains, for none other have they spared alive. And we suppose that they are now at this time in the land of Nephi; it is so if they are not slain."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,13,Alma 56:13,Alma 56:13,And now these are the cities of which the Lamanites have obtained possession by the shedding of the blood of so many of our valiant men;
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,14,Alma 56:14,Alma 56:14,"The land of Manti, or the city of Manti, and the city of Zeezrom, and the city of Cumeni, and the city of Antiparah."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,15,Alma 56:15,Alma 56:15,And these are the cities which they possessed when I arrived at the city of Judea; and I found Antipus and his men toiling with their might to fortify the city.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,16,Alma 56:16,Alma 56:16,"Yea, and they were depressed in body as well as in spirit, for they had fought valiantly by day and toiled by night to maintain their cities; and thus they had suffered great afflictions of every kind."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,17,Alma 56:17,Alma 56:17,"And now they were determined to conquer in this place or die; therefore you may well suppose that this little force which I brought with me, yea, those sons of mine, gave them great hopes and much joy."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,18,Alma 56:18,Alma 56:18,"And now it came to pass that when the Lamanites saw that Antipus had received a greater strength to his army, they were compelled by the orders of Ammoron to not come against the city of Judea, or against us, to battle."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,19,Alma 56:19,Alma 56:19,And thus were we favored of the Lord; for had they come upon us in this our weakness they might have perhaps destroyed our little army; but thus were we preserved.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,20,Alma 56:20,Alma 56:20,They were commanded by Ammoron to maintain those cities which they had taken. And thus ended the twenty and sixth year. And in the commencement of the twenty and seventh year we had prepared our city and ourselves for defence.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,21,Alma 56:21,Alma 56:21,Now we were desirous that the Lamanites should come upon us; for we were not desirous to make an attack upon them in their strongholds.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,22,Alma 56:22,Alma 56:22,"And it came to pass that we kept spies out round about, to watch the movements of the Lamanites, that they might not pass us by night nor by day to make an attack upon our other cities which were on the northward."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,23,Alma 56:23,Alma 56:23,"For we knew in those cities they were not sufficiently strong to meet them; therefore we were desirous, if they should pass by us, to fall upon them in their rear, and thus bring them up in the rear at the same time they were met in the front. We supposed that we could overpower them; but behold, we were disappointed in this our desire."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,24,Alma 56:24,Alma 56:24,"They durst not pass by us with their whole army, neither durst they with a part, lest they should not be sufficiently strong and they should fall."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,25,Alma 56:25,Alma 56:25,"Neither durst they march down against the city of Zarahemla; neither durst they cross the head of Sidon, over to the city of Nephihah."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,26,Alma 56:26,Alma 56:26,"And thus, with their forces, they were determined to maintain those cities which they had taken."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,27,Alma 56:27,Alma 56:27,"And now it came to pass in the second month of this year, there was brought unto us many provisions from the fathers of those my two thousand sons."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,28,Alma 56:28,Alma 56:28,"And also there were sent two thousand men unto us from the land of Zarahemla. And thus we were prepared with ten thousand men, and provisions for them, and also for their wives and their children."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,29,Alma 56:29,Alma 56:29,"And the Lamanites, thus seeing our forces increase daily, and provisions arrive for our support, they began to be fearful, and began to sally forth, if it were possible to put an end to our receiving provisions and strength."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,30,Alma 56:30,Alma 56:30,"Now when we saw that the Lamanites began to grow uneasy on this wise, we were desirous to bring a stratagem into effect upon them; therefore Antipus ordered that I should march forth with my little sons to a neighboring city, as if we were carrying provisions to a neighboring city."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,31,Alma 56:31,Alma 56:31,"And we were to march near the city of Antiparah, as if we were going to the city beyond, in the borders by the seashore."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,32,Alma 56:32,Alma 56:32,"And it came to pass that we did march forth, as if with our provisions, to go to that city."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,33,Alma 56:33,Alma 56:33,"And it came to pass that Antipus did march forth with a part of his army, leaving the remainder to maintain the city. But he did not march forth until I had gone forth with my little army, and came near the city Antiparah."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,34,Alma 56:34,Alma 56:34,"And now, in the city Antiparah were stationed the strongest army of the Lamanites; yea, the most numerous."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,35,Alma 56:35,Alma 56:35,"And it came to pass that when they had been informed by their spies, they came forth with their army and marched against us."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,36,Alma 56:36,Alma 56:36,"And it came to pass that we did flee before them, northward. And thus we did lead away the most powerful army of the Lamanites;"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,37,Alma 56:37,Alma 56:37,"Yea, even to a considerable distance, insomuch that when they saw the army of Antipus pursuing them, with their might, they did not turn to the right nor to the left, but pursued their march in a straight course after us; and, as we suppose, it was their intent to slay us before Antipus should overtake them, and this that they might not be surrounded by our people."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,38,Alma 56:38,Alma 56:38,"And now Antipus, beholding our danger, did speed the march of his army. But behold, it was night; therefore they did not overtake us, neither did Antipus overtake them; therefore we did camp for the night."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,39,Alma 56:39,Alma 56:39,"And it came to pass that before the dawn of the morning, behold, the Lamanites were pursuing us. Now we were not sufficiently strong to contend with them; yea, I would not suffer that my little sons should fall into their hands; therefore we did continue our march, and we took our march into the wilderness."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,40,Alma 56:40,Alma 56:40,"Now they durst not turn to the right nor to the left lest they should be surrounded; neither would I turn to the right nor to the left lest they should overtake me, and we could not stand against them, but be slain, and they would make their escape; and thus we did flee all that day into the wilderness, even until it was dark."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,41,Alma 56:41,Alma 56:41,"And it came to pass that again, when the light of the morning came we saw the Lamanites upon us, and we did flee before them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,42,Alma 56:42,Alma 56:42,But it came to pass that they did not pursue us far before they halted; and it was in the morning of the third day of the seventh month.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,43,Alma 56:43,Alma 56:43,"And now, whether they were overtaken by Antipus we knew not, but I said unto my men: Behold, we know not but they have halted for the purpose that we should come against them, that they might catch us in their snare;"

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,45,Alma 56:45,Alma 56:45,"And now I say unto you, my beloved brother Moroni, that never had I seen so great courage, nay, not amongst all the Nephites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,46,Alma 56:46,Alma 56:46,"For as I had ever called them my sons (for they were all of them very young) even so they said unto me: Father, behold our God is with us, and he will not suffer that we should fall; then let us go forth; we would not slay our brethren if they would let us alone; therefore let us go, lest they should overpower the army of Antipus."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,47,Alma 56:47,Alma 56:47,"Now they never had fought, yet they did not fear death; and they did think more upon the liberty of their fathers than they did upon their lives; yea, they had been taught by their mothers, that if they did not doubt, God would deliver them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,48,Alma 56:48,Alma 56:48,"And they rehearsed unto me the words of their mothers, saying: We do not doubt our mothers knew it."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,49,Alma 56:49,Alma 56:49,"And it came to pass that I did return with my two thousand against these Lamanites who had pursued us. And now behold, the armies of Antipus had overtaken them, and a terrible battle had commenced."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,50,Alma 56:50,Alma 56:50,"The army of Antipus being weary, because of their long march in so short a space of time, were about to fall into the hands of the Lamanites; and had I not returned with my two thousand they would have obtained their purpose."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,51,Alma 56:51,Alma 56:51,"For Antipus had fallen by the sword, and many of his leaders, because of their weariness, which was occasioned by the speed of their march--therefore the men of Antipus, being confused because of the fall of their leaders, began to give way before the Lamanites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,52,Alma 56:52,Alma 56:52,"And it came to pass that the Lamanites took courage, and began to pursue them; and thus were the Lamanites pursuing them with great vigor when Helaman came upon their rear with his two thousand, and began to slay them exceedingly, insomuch that the whole army of the Lamanites halted and turned upon Helaman."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,53,Alma 56:53,Alma 56:53,"Now when the people of Antipus saw that the Lamanites had turned them about, they gathered together their men and came again upon the rear of the Lamanites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,54,Alma 56:54,Alma 56:54,"And now it came to pass that we, the people of Nephi, the people of Antipus, and I with my two thousand, did surround the Lamanites, and did slay them; yea, insomuch that they were compelled to deliver up their weapons of war and also themselves as prisoners of war."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,55,Alma 56:55,Alma 56:55,"And now it came to pass that when they had surrendered themselves up unto us, behold, I numbered those young men who had fought with me, fearing lest there were many of them slain."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,56,Alma 56:56,Alma 56:56,"But behold, to my great joy, there had not one soul of them fallen to the earth; yea, and they had fought as if with the strength of God; yea, never were men known to have fought with such miraculous strength; and with such mighty power did they fall upon the Lamanites, that they did frighten them; and for this cause did the Lamanites deliver themselves up as prisoners of war."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,56,57,Alma 56:57,Alma 56:57,"And as we had no place for our prisoners, that we could guard them to keep them from the armies of the Lamanites, therefore we sent them to the land of Zarahemla, and a part of those men who were not slain of Antipus, with them; and the remainder I took and joined them to my stripling Ammonites, and took our march back to the city of Judea."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,57,1,Alma 57:1,Alma 57:1,"And now it came to pass that I received an epistle from Ammoron, the king, stating that if I would deliver up those prisoners of war whom we had taken that he would deliver up the city of Antiparah unto us."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,57,2,Alma 57:2,Alma 57:2,"But I sent an epistle unto the king, that we were sure our forces were sufficient to take the city of Antiparah by our force; and by delivering up the prisoners for that city we should suppose ourselves unwise, and that we would only deliver up our prisoners on exchange."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,57,3,Alma 57:3,Alma 57:3,"And Ammoron refused mine epistle, for he would not exchange prisoners; therefore we began to make preparations to go against the city of Antiparah."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,57,4,Alma 57:4,Alma 57:4,"But the people of Antiparah did leave the city, and fled to their other cities, which they had possession of, to fortify them; and thus the city of Antiparah fell into our hands."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,57,5,Alma 57:5,Alma 57:5,And thus ended the twenty and eighth year of the reign of the judges.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,57,6,Alma 57:6,Alma 57:6,"And it came to pass that in the commencement of the twenty and ninth year, we received a supply of provisions, and also an addition to our army, from the land of Zarahemla, and from the land round about, to the number of six thousand men, besides sixty of the sons of the Ammonites who had come to join their brethren, my little band of two thousand. And now behold, we were strong, yea, and we had also plenty of provisions brought unto us."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,57,7,Alma 57:7,Alma 57:7,And it came to pass that it was our desire to wage a battle with the army which was placed to protect the city Cumeni.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,57,8,Alma 57:8,Alma 57:8,"And now behold, I will show unto you that we soon accomplished our desire; yea, with our strong force, or with a part of our strong force, we did surround, by night, the city Cumeni, a little before they were to receive a supply of provisions."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,57,9,Alma 57:9,Alma 57:9,"And it came to pass that we did camp round about the city for many nights; but we did sleep upon our swords, and keep guards, that the Lamanites could not come upon us by night and slay us, which they attempted many times; but as many times as they attempted this their blood was spilt."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,57,10,Alma 57:10,Alma 57:10,"At length their provisions did arrive, and they were about to enter the city by night. And we, instead of being Lamanites, were Nephites; therefore, we did take them and their provisions."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,57,11,Alma 57:11,Alma 57:11,"And notwithstanding the Lamanites being cut off from their support after this manner, they were still determined to maintain the city; therefore it became expedient that we should take those provisions and send them to Judea, and our prisoners to the land of Zarahemla."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,57,12,Alma 57:12,Alma 57:12,And it came to pass that not many days had passed away before the Lamanites began to lose all hopes of succor; therefore they yielded up the city unto our hands; and thus we had accomplished our designs in obtaining the city Cumeni.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,57,13,Alma 57:13,Alma 57:13,"But it came to pass that our prisoners were so numerous that, notwithstanding the enormity of our numbers, we were obliged to employ all our force to keep them, or to put them to death."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,57,14,Alma 57:14,Alma 57:14,"For behold, they would break out in great numbers, and would fight with stones, and with clubs, or whatsoever thing they could get into their hands, insomuch that we did slay upwards of two thousand of them after they had surrendered themselves prisoners of war."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,57,15,Alma 57:15,Alma 57:15,"Therefore it became expedient for us, that we should put an end to their lives, or guard them, sword in hand, down to the land of Zarahemla; and also our provisions were not any more than sufficient for our own people, notwithstanding that which we had taken from the Lamanites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,57,16,Alma 57:16,Alma 57:16,"And now, in those critical circumstances, it became a very serious matter to determine concerning these prisoners of war; nevertheless, we did resolve to send them down to the land of Zarahemla; therefore we selected a part of our men, and gave them charge over our prisoners to go down to the land of Zarahemla."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,57,17,Alma 57:17,Alma 57:17,"But it came to pass that on the morrow they did return. And now behold, we did not inquire of them concerning the prisoners; for behold, the Lamanites were upon us, and they returned in season to save us from falling into their hands. For behold, Ammoron had sent to their support a new supply of provisions and also a numerous army of men."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,57,18,Alma 57:18,Alma 57:18,"And it came to pass that those men whom we sent with the prisoners did arrive in season to check them, as they were about to overpower us."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,57,19,Alma 57:19,Alma 57:19,"But behold, my little band of two thousand and sixty fought most desperately; yea, they were firm before the Lamanites, and did administer death unto all those who opposed them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,57,20,Alma 57:20,Alma 57:20,"And as the remainder of our army were about to give way before the Lamanites, behold, those two thousand and sixty were firm and undaunted."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,57,21,Alma 57:21,Alma 57:21,"Yea, and they did obey and observe to perform every word of command with exactness; yea, and even according to their faith it was done unto them; and I did remember the words which they said unto me that their mothers had taught them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,57,22,Alma 57:22,Alma 57:22,"And now behold, it was these my sons, and those men who had been selected to convey the prisoners, to whom we owe this great victory; for it was they who did beat the Lamanites; therefore they were driven back to the city of Manti."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,57,23,Alma 57:23,Alma 57:23,"And we retained our city Cumeni, and were not all destroyed by the sword; nevertheless, we had suffered great loss."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,57,24,Alma 57:24,Alma 57:24,"And it came to pass that after the Lamanites had fled, I immediately gave orders that my men who had been wounded should be taken from among the dead, and caused that their wounds should be dressed."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,57,25,Alma 57:25,Alma 57:25,"And it came to pass that there were two hundred, out of my two thousand and sixty, who had fainted because of the loss of blood; nevertheless, according to the goodness of God, and to our great astonishment, and also the joy of our whole army, there was not one soul of them who did perish; yea, and neither was there one soul among them who had not received many wounds."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,57,26,Alma 57:26,Alma 57:26,"And now, their preservation was astonishing to our whole army, yea, that they should be spared while there was a thousand of our brethren who were slain. And we do justly ascribe it to the miraculous power of God, because of their exceeding faith in that which they had been taught to believe--that there was a just God, and whosoever did not doubt, that they should be preserved by his marvelous power."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,57,27,Alma 57:27,Alma 57:27,"Now this was the faith of these of whom I have spoken; they are young, and their minds are firm, and they do put their trust in God continually."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,57,28,Alma 57:28,Alma 57:28,"And now it came to pass that after we had thus taken care of our wounded men, and had buried our dead and also the dead of the Lamanites, who were many, behold, we did inquire of Gid concerning the prisoners whom they had started to go down to the land of Zarahemla with."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,57,29,Alma 57:29,Alma 57:29,Now Gid was the chief captain over the band who was appointed to guard them down to the land.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,57,30,Alma 57:30,Alma 57:30,"And now, these are the words which Gid said unto me: Behold, we did start to go down to the land of Zarahemla with our prisoners. And it came to pass that we did meet the spies of our armies, who had been sent out to watch the camp of the Lamanites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,57,31,Alma 57:31,Alma 57:31,"And they cried unto us, saying--Behold, the armies of the Lamanites are marching towards the city of Cumeni; and behold, they will fall upon them, yea, and will destroy our people."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,57,32,Alma 57:32,Alma 57:32,"And it came to pass that our prisoners did hear their cries, which caused them to take courage; and they did rise up in rebellion against us."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,57,33,Alma 57:33,Alma 57:33,"And it came to pass because of their rebellion we did cause that our swords should come upon them. And it came to pass that they did in a body run upon our swords, in the which, the greater number of them were slain; and the remainder of them broke through and fled from us."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,57,34,Alma 57:34,Alma 57:34,"And behold, when they had fled and we could not overtake them, we took our march with speed towards the city Cumeni; and behold, we did arrive in time that we might assist our brethren in preserving the city."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,57,35,Alma 57:35,Alma 57:35,"And behold, we are again delivered out of the hands of our enemies. And blessed is the name of our God; for behold, it is he that has delivered us; yea, that has done this great thing for us."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,57,36,Alma 57:36,Alma 57:36,"Now it came to pass that when I, Helaman, had heard these words of Gid, I was filled with exceeding joy because of the goodness of God in preserving us, that we might not all perish; yea, and I trust that the souls of them who have been slain have entered into the rest of their God."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,58,1,Alma 58:1,Alma 58:1,"And behold, now it came to pass that our next object was to obtain the city of Manti; but behold, there was no way that we could lead them out of the city by our small bands. For behold, they remembered that which we had hitherto done; therefore we could not decoy them away from their strongholds."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,58,2,Alma 58:2,Alma 58:2,And they were so much more numerous than was our army that we durst not go forth and attack them in their strongholds.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,58,3,Alma 58:3,Alma 58:3,"Yea, and it became expedient that we should employ our men to the maintaining those parts of the land which we had regained of our possessions; therefore it became expedient that we should wait, that we might receive more strength from the land of Zarahemla and also a new supply of provisions."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,58,4,Alma 58:4,Alma 58:4,"And it came to pass that I thus did send an embassy to the governor of our land, to acquaint him concerning the affairs of our people. And it came to pass that we did wait to receive provisions and strength from the land of Zarahemla."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,58,5,Alma 58:5,Alma 58:5,"But behold, this did profit us but little; for the Lamanites were also receiving great strength from day to day, and also many provisions; and thus were our circumstances at this period of time."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,58,6,Alma 58:6,Alma 58:6,"And the Lamanites were sallying forth against us from time to time, resolving by stratagem to destroy us; nevertheless we could not come to battle with them, because of their retreats and their strongholds."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,58,7,Alma 58:7,Alma 58:7,"And it came to pass that we did wait in these difficult circumstances for the space of many months, even until we were about to perish for the want of food."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,58,8,Alma 58:8,Alma 58:8,"But it came to pass that we did receive food, which was guarded to us by an army of two thousand men to our assistance; and this is all the assistance which we did receive, to defend ourselves and our country from falling into the hands of our enemies, yea, to contend with an enemy which was innumerable."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,58,9,Alma 58:9,Alma 58:9,"And now the cause of these our embarrassments, or the cause why they did not send more strength unto us, we knew not; therefore we were grieved and also filled with fear, lest by any means the judgments of God should come upon our land, to our overthrow and utter destruction."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,58,10,Alma 58:10,Alma 58:10,"Therefore we did pour out our souls in prayer to God, that he would strengthen us and deliver us out of the hands of our enemies, yea, and also give us strength that we might retain our cities, and our lands, and our possessions, for the support of our people."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,58,11,Alma 58:11,Alma 58:11,"Yea, and it came to pass that the Lord our God did visit us with assurances that he would deliver us; yea, insomuch that he did speak peace to our souls, and did grant unto us great faith, and did cause us that we should hope for our deliverance in him."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,58,13,Alma 58:13,Alma 58:13,"And thus we did go forth with all our might against the Lamanites, who were in the city of Manti; and we did pitch our tents by the wilderness side, which was near to the city."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,58,14,Alma 58:14,Alma 58:14,"And it came to pass that on the morrow, that when the Lamanites saw that we were in the borders by the wilderness which was near the city, that they sent out their spies round about us that they might discover the number and the strength of our army."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,58,15,Alma 58:15,Alma 58:15,"And it came to pass that when they saw that we were not strong, according to our numbers, and fearing that we should cut them off from their support except they should come out to battle against us and kill us, and also supposing that they could easily destroy us with their numerous hosts, therefore they began to make preparations to come out against us to battle."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,58,17,Alma 58:17,Alma 58:17,"Now Gid and his men were on the right and the others on the left; and when they had thus secreted themselves, behold, I remained, with the remainder of my army, in that same place where we had first pitched our tents against the time that the Lamanites should come out to battle."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,58,18,Alma 58:18,Alma 58:18,"And it came to pass that the Lamanites did come out with their numerous army against us.

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,58,20,Alma 58:20,Alma 58:20,"And it came to pass that when the Lamanites had passed by, or when the army had passed by, Gid and Teomner did rise up from their secret places, and did cut off the spies of the Lamanites that they should not return to the city."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,58,21,Alma 58:21,Alma 58:21,"And it came to pass that when they had cut them off, they ran to the city and fell upon the guards who were left to guard the city, insomuch that they did destroy them and did take possession of the city."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,58,22,Alma 58:22,Alma 58:22,"Now this was done because the Lamanites did suffer their whole army, save a few guards only, to be led away into the wilderness."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,58,25,Alma 58:25,Alma 58:25,"And behold, it was night and they did pitch their tents, for the chief captains of the Lamanites had supposed that the Nephites were weary because of their march; and supposing that they had driven their whole army therefore they took no thought concerning the city of Manti."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,58,26,Alma 58:26,Alma 58:26,"Now it came to pass that when it was night, I caused that my men should not sleep, but that they should march forward by another way towards the land of Manti."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,62,33,Alma 62:33,Alma 62:33,"And the armies of the Lamanites were all gathered together, insomuch that they were all in one body in the land of Moroni. Now Ammoron, the king of the Lamanites, was also with them."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,62,35,Alma 62:35,Alma 62:35,"And thus they did encamp for the night. For behold, the Nephites and the Lamanites also were weary because of the greatness of the march; therefore they did not resolve upon any stratagem in the night-time, save it were Teancum; for he was exceedingly angry with Ammoron, insomuch that he considered that Ammoron, and Amalickiah his brother, had been the cause of this great and lasting war between them and the Lamanites, which had been the cause of so much war and bloodshed, yea, and so much famine."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,62,36,Alma 62:36,Alma 62:36,"And it came to pass that Teancum in his anger did go forth into the camp of the Lamanites, and did let himself down over the walls of the city. And he went forth with a cord, from place to place, insomuch that he did find the king; and he did cast a javelin at him, which did pierce him near the heart. But behold, the king did awaken his servants before he died, insomuch that they did pursue Teancum, and slew him."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,62,37,Alma 62:37,Alma 62:37,"Now it came to pass that when Lehi and Moroni knew that Teancum was dead they were exceedingly sorrowful; for behold, he had been a man who had fought valiantly for his country, yea, a true friend to liberty; and he had suffered very many exceedingly sore afflictions. But behold, he was dead, and had gone the way of all the earth."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,62,38,Alma 62:38,Alma 62:38,"Now it came to pass that Moroni marched forth on the morrow, and came upon the Lamanites, insomuch that they did slay them with a great slaughter; and they did drive them out of the land; and they did flee, even that they did not return at that time against the Nephites."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,62,39,Alma 62:39,Alma 62:39,"And thus ended the thirty and first year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi; and thus they had had wars, and bloodsheds, and famine, and affliction, for the space of many years."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,62,40,Alma 62:40,Alma 62:40,"And there had been murders, and contentions, and dissensions, and all manner of iniquity among the people of Nephi; nevertheless for the righteous' sake, yea, because of the prayers of the righteous, they were spared."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,62,44,Alma 62:44,Alma 62:44,And Pahoran did return to his judgment-seat; and Helaman did take upon him again to preach unto the people the word of God; for because of so many wars and contentions it had become expedient that a regulation should be made again in the church.
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Alma,62,45,Alma 62:45,Alma 62:45,"Therefore, Helaman and his brethren went forth, and did declare the word of God with much power unto the convincing of many people of their wickedness, which did cause them to repent of their sins and to be baptized unto the Lord their God."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Helaman,1,25,Helaman 1:25,Hel. 1:25,"But behold, this march of Coriantumr through the center of the land gave Moronihah great advantage over them, notwithstanding the greatness of the number of the Nephites who were slain."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Helaman,1,26,Helaman 1:26,Hel. 1:26,"For behold, Moronihah had supposed that the Lamanites durst not come into the center of the land, but that they would attack the cities round about in the borders as they had hitherto done; therefore Moronihah had caused that their strong armies should maintain those parts round about by the borders."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Helaman,1,27,Helaman 1:27,Hel. 1:27,"But behold, the Lamanites were not frightened according to his desire, but they had come into the center of the land, and had taken the capital city which was the city of Zarahemla, and were marching through the most capital parts of the land, slaying the people with a great slaughter, both men, women, and children, taking possession of many cities and of many strongholds."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Helaman,2,4,Helaman 2:4,Hel. 2:4,"For there was one Gadianton, who was exceedingly expert in many words, and also in his craft, to carry on the secret work of murder and of robbery; therefore he became the leader of the band of Kishkumen."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,Helaman,2,5,Helaman 2:5,Hel. 2:5,"Therefore he did flatter them, and also Kishkumen, that if they would place him in the judgment-seat he would grant unto those who belonged to his band that they should be placed in power and authority among the people; therefore Kishkumen sought to destroy Helaman."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,3 Nephi,2,11,3 Nephi 2:11,3 Ne. 2:11,"And it came to pass in the thirteenth year there began to be wars and contentions throughout all the land; for the Gadianton robbers had become so numerous, and did slay so many of the people, and did lay waste so many cities, and did spread so much death and carnage throughout the land, that it became expedient that all the people, both the Nephites and the Lamanites, should take up arms against them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,3 Nephi,2,12,3 Nephi 2:12,3 Ne. 2:12,"Therefore, all the Lamanites who had become converted unto the Lord did unite with their brethren, the Nephites, and were compelled, for the safety of their lives and their women and their children, to take up arms against those Gadianton robbers, yea, and also to maintain their rights, and the privileges of their church and of their worship, and their freedom and their liberty."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,3 Nephi,3,3,3 Nephi 3:3,3 Ne. 3:3,"And it seemeth a pity unto me, most noble Lachoneus, that ye should be so foolish and vain as to suppose that ye can stand against so many brave men who are at my command, who do now at this time stand in their arms, and do await with great anxiety for the word--Go down upon the Nephites and destroy them."

I am Giddianhi."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,3 Nephi,3,11,3 Nephi 3:11,3 Ne. 3:11,"And now it came to pass when Lachoneus received this epistle he was exceedingly astonished, because of the boldness of Giddianhi demanding the possession of the land of the Nephites, and also of threatening the people and avenging the wrongs of those that had received no wrong, save it were they had wronged themselves by dissenting away unto those wicked and abominable robbers."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,3 Nephi,3,12,3 Nephi 3:12,3 Ne. 3:12,"Now behold, this Lachoneus, the governor, was a just man, and could not be frightened by the demands and the threatenings of a robber; therefore he did not hearken to the epistle of Giddianhi, the governor of the robbers, but he did cause that his people should cry unto the Lord for strength against the time that the robbers should come down against them."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,3 Nephi,3,13,3 Nephi 3:13,3 Ne. 3:13,"Yea, he sent a proclamation among all the people, that they should gather together their women, and their children, their flocks and their herds, and all their substance, save it were their land, unto one place."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,3 Nephi,3,21,3 Nephi 3:21,3 Ne. 3:21,"But Gidgiddoni saith unto them: The Lord forbid; for if we should go up against them the Lord would deliver us into their hands; therefore we will prepare ourselves in the center of our lands, and we will gather all our armies together, and we will not go against them, but we will wait till they shall come against us; therefore as the Lord liveth, if we do this he will deliver them into our hands."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,3 Nephi,3,22,3 Nephi 3:22,3 Ne. 3:22,"And it came to pass in the seventeenth year, in the latter end of the year, the proclamation of Lachoneus had gone forth throughout all the face of the land, and they had taken their horses, and their chariots, and their cattle, and all their flocks, and their herds, and their grain, and all their substance, and did march forth by thousands and by tens of thousands, until they had all gone forth to the place which had been appointed that they should gather themselves together, to defend themselves against their enemies."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,3 Nephi,4,3,3 Nephi 4:3,3 Ne. 4:3,"And the robbers could not exist save it were in the wilderness, for the want of food; for the Nephites had left their lands desolate, and had gathered their flocks and their herds and all their substance, and they were in one body."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,3 Nephi,4,4,3 Nephi 4:4,3 Ne. 4:4,"Therefore, there was no chance for the robbers to plunder and to obtain food, save it were to come up in open battle against the Nephites; and the Nephites being in one body, and having so great a number, and having reserved for themselves provisions, and horses and cattle, and flocks of every kind, that they might subsist for the space of seven years, in the which time they did hope to destroy the robbers from off the face of the land; and thus the eighteenth year did pass away."

Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,3 Nephi,4,17,3 Nephi 4:17,3 Ne. 4:17,"Now they had appointed unto themselves another leader, whose name was Zemnarihah; therefore it was Zemnarihah that did cause that this siege should take place."
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,3 Nephi,4,18,3 Nephi 4:18,3 Ne. 4:18,"But behold, this was an advantage to the Nephites; for it was impossible for the robbers to lay siege sufficiently long to have any effect upon the Nephites, because of their much provision which they had laid up in store,"
Book of Mormon,Book of Mormon,3 Nephi,4,19,3 Nephi 4:19,3 Ne. 4:19,"And because of the scantiness of provisions among the robbers; for behold, they had nothing save it were meat for their subsistence, which meat they did obtain in the wilderness;"

It is sufficient to know, in this case, that the earth will be smitten with a curse unless there is a welding link of some kind or other between the fathers and the children, upon some subject or other--and behold what is that subject? It is the baptism for the dead. For we without them cannot be made perfect; neither can they without us be made perfect. Neither can they nor we be made perfect without those who have died in the gospel also; for it is necessary in the ushering in of the dispensation of the fulness of times, which dispensation is now beginning to usher in, that a whole and complete and perfect union, and welding together of dispensations, and keys, and powers, and glories should take place, and be revealed from the days of Adam even to the present time.

Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,6,Joseph Smith--History 1:6,JS-H 1:6,"For, notwithstanding the great love which the converts to these different faiths expressed at the time of their conversion, and the great zeal manifested by the respective clergy, who were active in getting up and promoting this extraordinary scene of religious feeling, in order to have everybody converted, as they were pleased to call it, let them join what sect they pleased; yet when the converts began to file off, some to one party and some to another, it was seen that the seemingly good feelings of both the priests and the converts were more pretended than real; for a scene of great confusion and bad feeling ensued--priest contending against priest, and convert against convert; so that all their good feelings one for another, if they ever had any, were entirely lost in a strife of words and a contest about opinions."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,7,Joseph Smith--History 1:7,JS-H 1:7,"I was at this time in my fifteenth year. My father's family was proselyted to the Presbyterian faith, and four of them joined that church, namely, my mother, Lucy; my brothers Hyrum and Samuel Harrison; and my sister Sophronia."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,8,Joseph Smith--History 1:8,JS-H 1:8,"During this time of great excitement my mind was called up to serious reflection and great uneasiness; but though my feelings were deep and often poignant, still I kept myself aloof from all these parties, though I attended their several meetings as often as occasion would permit. In process of time my mind became somewhat partial to the Methodist sect, and I felt some desire to be united with them; but so great were the confusion and strife among the different denominations, that it was impossible for a person young as I was, and so unacquainted with men and things, to come to any certain conclusion who was right and who was wrong."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,9,Joseph Smith--History 1:9,JS-H 1:9,"My mind at times was greatly excited, the cry and tumult were so great and incessant. The Presbyterians were most decided against the Baptists and Methodists, and used all the powers of both reason and sophistry to prove their errors, or, at least, to make the people think they were in error. On the other hand, the Baptists and Methodists in their turn were equally zealous in endeavoring to establish their own tenets and disprove all others."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,10,Joseph Smith--History 1:10,JS-H 1:10,"In the midst of this war of words and tumult of opinions, I often said to myself: What is to be done? Who of all these parties are right; or, are they all wrong together? If any one of them be right, which is it, and how shall I know it?"
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,11,Joseph Smith--History 1:11,JS-H 1:11,"While I was laboring under the extreme difficulties caused by the contests of these parties of religionists, I was one day reading the Epistle of James, first chapter and fifth verse, which reads: If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,12,Joseph Smith--History 1:12,JS-H 1:12,"Never did any passage of scripture come with more power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine. It seemed to enter with great force into every feeling of my heart. I reflected on it again and again, knowing that if any person needed wisdom from God, I did; for how to act I did not know, and unless I could get more wisdom than I then had, I would never know; for the teachers of religion of the different sects understood the same passages of scripture so differently as to destroy all confidence in settling the question by an appeal to the Bible."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,13,Joseph Smith--History 1:13,JS-H 1:13,"At length I came to the conclusion that I must either remain in darkness and confusion, or else I must do as James directs, that is, ask of God. I at length came to the determination to ""ask of God,"" concluding that if he gave wisdom to them that lacked wisdom, and would give liberally, and not upbraid, I might venture."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,14,Joseph Smith--History 1:14,JS-H 1:14,"So, in accordance with this, my determination to ask of God, I retired to the woods to make the attempt. It was on the morning of a beautiful, clear day, early in the spring of eighteen hundred and twenty. It was the first time in my life that I had made such an attempt, for amidst all my anxieties I had never as yet made the attempt to pray vocally."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,15,Joseph Smith--History 1:15,JS-H 1:15,"After I had retired to the place where I had previously designed to go, having looked around me, and finding myself alone, I kneeled down and began to offer up the desires of my heart to God. I had scarcely done so, when immediately I was seized upon by some power which entirely overcame me, and had such an astonishing influence over me as to bind my tongue so that I could not speak. Thick darkness gathered around me, and it seemed to me for a time as if I were doomed to sudden destruction."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,16,Joseph Smith--History 1:16,JS-H 1:16,"But, exerting all my powers to call upon God to deliver me out of the power of this enemy which had seized upon me, and at the very moment when I was ready to sink into despair and abandon myself to destruction--not to an imaginary ruin, but to the power of some actual being from the unseen world, who had such marvelous power as I had never before felt in any being--just at this moment of great alarm, I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,17,Joseph Smith--History 1:17,JS-H 1:17,"It no sooner appeared than I found myself delivered from the enemy which held me bound. When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other--This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!"
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,18,Joseph Smith--History 1:18,JS-H 1:18,"My object in going to inquire of the Lord was to know which of all the sects was right, that I might know which to join. No sooner, therefore, did I get possession of myself, so as to be able to speak, than I asked the Personages who stood above me in the light, which of all the sects was right (for at this time it had never entered into my heart that all were wrong)--and which I should join."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,19,Joseph Smith--History 1:19,JS-H 1:19,"I was answered that I must join none of them, for they were all wrong; and the Personage who addressed me said that all their creeds were an abomination in his sight; that those professors were all corrupt; that: ""they draw near to me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me, they teach for doctrines the commandments of men, having a form of godliness, but they deny the power thereof."""
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,20,Joseph Smith--History 1:20,JS-H 1:20,"He again forbade me to join with any of them; and many other things did he say unto me, which I cannot write at this time. When I came to myself again, I found myself lying on my back, looking up into heaven. When the light had departed, I had no strength; but soon recovering in some degree, I went home. And as I leaned up to the fireplace, mother inquired what the matter was. I replied, ""Never mind, all is well--I am well enough off."" I then said to my mother, ""I have learned for myself that Presbyterianism is not true."" It seems as though the adversary was aware, at a very early period of my life, that I was destined to prove a disturber and an annoyer of his kingdom; else why should the powers of darkness combine against me? Why the opposition and persecution that arose against me, almost in my infancy?"
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,21,Joseph Smith--History 1:21,JS-H 1:21,"Some few days after I had this vision, I happened to be in company with one of the Methodist preachers, who was very active in the before mentioned religious excitement; and, conversing with him on the subject of religion, I took occasion to give him an account of the vision which I had had. I was greatly surprised at his behavior; he treated my communication not only lightly, but with great contempt, saying it was all of the devil, that there were no such things as visions or revelations in these days; that all such things had ceased with the apostles, and that there would never be any more of them."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,22,Joseph Smith--History 1:22,JS-H 1:22,"I soon found, however, that my telling the story had excited a great deal of prejudice against me among professors of religion, and was the cause of great persecution, which continued to increase; and though I was an obscure boy, only between fourteen and fifteen years of age, and my circumstances in life such as to make a boy of no consequence in the world, yet men of high standing would take notice sufficient to excite the public mind against me, and create a bitter persecution; and this was common among all the sects--all united to persecute me."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,23,Joseph Smith--History 1:23,JS-H 1:23,"It caused me serious reflection then, and often has since, how very strange it was that an obscure boy, of a little over fourteen years of age, and one, too, who was doomed to the necessity of obtaining a scanty maintenance by his daily labor, should be thought a character of sufficient importance to attract the attention of the great ones of the most popular sects of the day, and in a manner to create in them a spirit of the most bitter persecution and reviling. But strange or not, so it was, and it was often the cause of great sorrow to myself."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,24,Joseph Smith--History 1:24,JS-H 1:24,"However, it was nevertheless a fact that I had beheld a vision. I have thought since, that I felt much like Paul, when he made his defense before King Agrippa, and related the account of the vision he had when he saw a light, and heard a voice; but still there were but few who believed him; some said he was dishonest, others said he was mad; and he was ridiculed and reviled. But all this did not destroy the reality of his vision. He had seen a vision, he knew he had, and all the persecution under heaven could not make it otherwise; and though they should persecute him unto death, yet he knew, and would know to his latest breath, that he had both seen a light and heard a voice speaking unto him, and all the world could not make him think or believe otherwise."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,25,Joseph Smith--History 1:25,JS-H 1:25,"So it was with me. I had actually seen a light, and in the midst of that light I saw two Personages, and they did in reality speak to me; and though I was hated and persecuted for saying that I had seen a vision, yet it was true; and while they were persecuting me, reviling me, and speaking all manner of evil against me falsely for so saying, I was led to say in my heart: Why persecute me for telling the truth? I have actually seen a vision; and who am I that I can withstand God, or why does the world think to make me deny what I have actually seen? For I had seen a vision; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it, neither dared I do it; at least I knew that by so doing I would offend God, and come under condemnation."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,26,Joseph Smith--History 1:26,JS-H 1:26,"I had now got my mind satisfied so far as the sectarian world was concerned--that it was not my duty to join with any of them, but to continue as I was until further directed. I had found the testimony of James to be true--that a man who lacked wisdom might ask of God, and obtain, and not be upbraided."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,27,Joseph Smith--History 1:27,JS-H 1:27,"I continued to pursue my common vocations in life until the twenty--first of September, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-three, all the time suffering severe persecution at the hands of all classes of men, both religious and irreligious, because I continued to affirm that I had seen a vision."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,28,Joseph Smith--History 1:28,JS-H 1:28,"During the space of time which intervened between the time I had the vision and the year eighteen hundred and twenty-three--having been forbidden to join any of the religious sects of the day, and being of very tender years, and persecuted by those who ought to have been my friends and to have treated me kindly, and if they supposed me to be deluded to have endeavored in a proper and affectionate manner to have reclaimed me--I was left to all kinds of temptations; and, mingling with all kinds of society, I frequently fell into many foolish errors, and displayed the weakness of youth, and the foibles of human nature; which, I am sorry to say, led me into divers temptations, offensive in the sight of God. In making this confession, no one need suppose me guilty of any great or malignant sins. A disposition to commit such was never in my nature. But I was guilty of levity, and sometimes associated with jovial company, etc., not consistent with that character which ought to be maintained by one who was called of God as I had been. But this will not seem very strange to any one who recollects my youth, and is acquainted with my native cheery temperament."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,29,Joseph Smith--History 1:29,JS-H 1:29,"In consequence of these things, I often felt condemned for my weakness and imperfections; when, on the evening of the above-mentioned twenty-first of September, after I had retired to my bed for the night, I betook myself to prayer and supplication to Almighty God for forgiveness of all my sins and follies, and also for a manifestation to me, that I might know of my state and standing before him; for I had full confidence in obtaining a divine manifestation, as I previously had one."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,30,Joseph Smith--History 1:30,JS-H 1:30,"While I was thus in the act of calling upon God, I discovered a light appearing in my room, which continued to increase until the room was lighter than at noonday, when immediately a personage appeared at my bedside, standing in the air, for his feet did not touch the floor."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,31,Joseph Smith--History 1:31,JS-H 1:31,"He had on a loose robe of most exquisite whiteness. It was a whiteness beyond anything earthly I had ever seen; nor do I believe that any earthly thing could be made to appear so exceedingly white and brilliant. His hands were naked, and his arms also, a little above the wrist; so, also, were his feet naked, as were his legs, a little above the ankles. His head and neck were also bare. I could discover that he had no other clothing on but this robe, as it was open, so that I could see into his bosom."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,32,Joseph Smith--History 1:32,JS-H 1:32,"Not only was his robe exceedingly white, but his whole person was glorious beyond description, and his countenance truly like lightning. The room was exceedingly light, but not so very bright as immediately around his person. When I first looked upon him, I was afraid; but the fear soon left me."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,33,Joseph Smith--History 1:33,JS-H 1:33,"He called me by name, and said unto me that he was a messenger sent from the presence of God to me, and that his name was Moroni; that God had a work for me to do; and that my name should be had for good and evil among all nations, kindreds, and tongues, or that it should be both good and evil spoken of among all people."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,34,Joseph Smith--History 1:34,JS-H 1:34,"He said there was a book deposited, written upon gold plates, giving an account of the former inhabitants of this continent, and the source from whence they sprang. He also said that the fulness of the everlasting Gospel was contained in it, as delivered by the Savior to the ancient inhabitants;"
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,35,Joseph Smith--History 1:35,JS-H 1:35,"Also, that there were two stones in silver bows--and these stones, fastened to a breastplate, constituted what is called the Urim and Thummim--deposited with the plates; and the possession and use of these stones were what constituted ""seers"" in ancient or former times; and that God had prepared them for the purpose of translating the book."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,36,Joseph Smith--History 1:36,JS-H 1:36,"After telling me these things, he commenced quoting the prophecies of the Old Testament. He first quoted part of the third chapter of Malachi; and he quoted also the fourth or last chapter of the same prophecy, though with a little variation from the way it reads in our Bibles. Instead of quoting the first verse as it reads in our books, he quoted it thus:"
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,37,Joseph Smith--History 1:37,JS-H 1:37,"For behold, the day cometh that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly shall burn as stubble; for they that come shall burn them, saith the Lord of Hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,38,Joseph Smith--History 1:38,JS-H 1:38,"And again, he quoted the fifth verse thus: Behold, I will reveal unto you the Priesthood, by the hand of Elijah the prophet, before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,39,Joseph Smith--History 1:39,JS-H 1:39,"He also quoted the next verse differently: And he shall plant in the hearts of the children the promises made to the fathers, and the hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers. If it were not so, the whole earth would be utterly wasted at his coming."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,40,Joseph Smith--History 1:40,JS-H 1:40,"In addition to these, he quoted the eleventh chapter of Isaiah, saying that it was about to be fulfilled. He quoted also the third chapter of Acts, twenty-second and twenty-third verses, precisely as they stand in our New Testament. He said that that prophet was Christ; but the day had not yet come when ""they who would not hear his voice should be cut off from among the people,"" but soon would come."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,41,Joseph Smith--History 1:41,JS-H 1:41,"He also quoted the second chapter of Joel, from the twenty-eighth verse to the last. He also said that this was not yet fulfilled, but was soon to be. And he further stated that the fulness of the Gentiles was soon to come in. He quoted many other passages of scripture, and offered many explanations which cannot be mentioned here."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,42,Joseph Smith--History 1:42,JS-H 1:42,"Again, he told me, that when I got those plates of which he had spoken--for the time that they should be obtained was not yet fulfilled--I should not show them to any person; neither the breastplate with the Urim and Thummim; only to those to whom I should be commanded to show them; if I did I should be destroyed. While he was conversing with me about the plates, the vision was opened to my mind that I could see the place where the plates were deposited, and that so clearly and distinctly that I knew the place again when I visited it."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,43,Joseph Smith--History 1:43,JS-H 1:43,"After this communication, I saw the light in the room begin to gather immediately around the person of him who had been speaking to me, and it continued to do so until the room was again left dark, except just around him; when, instantly I saw, as it were, a conduit open right up into heaven, and he ascended till he entirely disappeared, and the room was left as it had been before this heavenly light had made its appearance."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,44,Joseph Smith--History 1:44,JS-H 1:44,"I lay musing on the singularity of the scene, and marveling greatly at what had been told to me by this extraordinary messenger; when, in the midst of my meditation, I suddenly discovered that my room was again beginning to get lighted, and in an instant, as it were, the same heavenly messenger was again by my bedside."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,45,Joseph Smith--History 1:45,JS-H 1:45,"He commenced, and again related the very same things which he had done at his first visit, without the least variation; which having done, he informed me of great judgments which were coming upon the earth, with great desolations by famine, sword, and pestilence; and that these grievous judgments would come on the earth in this generation. Having related these things, he again ascended as he had done before."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,46,Joseph Smith--History 1:46,JS-H 1:46,"By this time, so deep were the impressions made on my mind, that sleep had fled from my eyes, and I lay overwhelmed in astonishment at what I had both seen and heard. But what was my surprise when again I beheld the same messenger at my bedside, and heard him rehearse or repeat over again to me the same things as before; and added a caution to me, telling me that Satan would try to tempt me (in consequence of the indigent circumstances of my father's family), to get the plates for the purpose of getting rich. This he forbade me, saying that I must have no other object in view in getting the plates but to glorify God, and must not be influenced by any other motive than that of building his kingdom; otherwise I could not get them."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,47,Joseph Smith--History 1:47,JS-H 1:47,"After this third visit, he again ascended into heaven as before, and I was again left to ponder on the strangeness of what I had just experienced; when almost immediately after the heavenly messenger had ascended from me for the third time, the cock crowed, and I found that day was approaching, so that our interviews must have occupied the whole of that night."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,48,Joseph Smith--History 1:48,JS-H 1:48,"I shortly after arose from my bed, and, as usual, went to the necessary labors of the day; but, in attempting to work as at other times, I found my strength so exhausted as to render me entirely unable. My father, who was laboring along with me, discovered something to be wrong with me, and told me to go home. I started with the intention of going to the house; but, in attempting to cross the fence out of the field where we were, my strength entirely failed me, and I fell helpless on the ground, and for a time was quite unconscious of anything."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,49,Joseph Smith--History 1:49,JS-H 1:49,"The first thing that I can recollect was a voice speaking unto me, calling me by name. I looked up, and beheld the same messenger standing over my head, surrounded by light as before. He then again related unto me all that he had related to me the previous night, and commanded me to go to my father and tell him of the vision and commandments which I had received."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,50,Joseph Smith--History 1:50,JS-H 1:50,"I obeyed; I returned to my father in the field, and rehearsed the whole matter to him. He replied to me that it was of God, and told me to go and do as commanded by the messenger. I left the field, and went to the place where the messenger had told me the plates were deposited; and owing to the distinctness of the vision which I had had concerning it, I knew the place the instant that I arrived there."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,51,Joseph Smith--History 1:51,JS-H 1:51,"Convenient to the village of Manchester, Ontario county, New York, stands a hill of considerable size, and the most elevated of any in the neighborhood. On the west side of this hill, not far from the top, under a stone of considerable size, lay the plates, deposited in a stone box. This stone was thick and rounding in the middle on the upper side, and thinner towards the edges, so that the middle part of it was visible above the ground, but the edge all around was covered with earth."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,52,Joseph Smith--History 1:52,JS-H 1:52,"Having removed the earth, I obtained a lever, which I got fixed under the edge of the stone, and with a little exertion raised it up. I looked in, and there indeed did I behold the plates, the Urim and Thummim, and the breastplate, as stated by the messenger. The box in which they lay was formed by laying stones together in some kind of cement. In the bottom of the box were laid two stones crossways of the box, and on these stones lay the plates and the other things with them."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,53,Joseph Smith--History 1:53,JS-H 1:53,"I made an attempt to take them out, but was forbidden by the messenger, and was again informed that the time for bringing them forth had not yet arrived, neither would it, until four years from that time; but he told me that I should come to that place precisely in one year from that time, and that he would there meet with me, and that I should continue to do so until the time should come for obtaining the plates."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,54,Joseph Smith--History 1:54,JS-H 1:54,"Accordingly, as I had been commanded, I went at the end of each year, and at each time I found the same messenger there, and received instruction and intelligence from him at each of our interviews, respecting what the Lord was going to do, and how and in what manner his kingdom was to be conducted in the last days."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,55,Joseph Smith--History 1:55,JS-H 1:55,"As my father's worldly circumstances were very limited, we were under the necessity of laboring with our hands, hiring out by day's work and otherwise, as we could get opportunity. Sometimes we were at home, and sometimes abroad, and by continuous labor were enabled to get a comfortable maintenance."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,56,Joseph Smith--History 1:56,JS-H 1:56,"In the year 1823 my father's family met with a great affliction by the death of my eldest brother, Alvin. In the month of October, 1825, I hired with an old gentleman by the name of Josiah Stoal, who lived in Chenango county, State of New York. He had heard something of a silver mine having been opened by the Spaniards in Harmony, Susquehanna county, State of Pennsylvania; and had, previous to my hiring to him, been digging, in order, if possible, to discover the mine. After I went to live with him, he took me, with the rest of his hands, to dig for the silver mine, at which I continued to work for nearly a month, without success in our undertaking, and finally I prevailed with the old gentleman to cease digging after it. Hence arose the very prevalent story of my having been a money-digger."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,57,Joseph Smith--History 1:57,JS-H 1:57,"During the time that I was thus employed, I was put to board with a Mr. Isaac Hale, of that place; it was there I first saw my wife (his daughter), Emma Hale. On the 18th of January, 1827, we were married, while I was yet employed in the service of Mr. Stoal."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,58,Joseph Smith--History 1:58,JS-H 1:58,"Owing to my continuing to assert that I had seen a vision, persecution still followed me, and my wife's father's family were very much opposed to our being married. I was, therefore, under the necessity of taking her elsewhere; so we went and were married at the house of Squire Tarbill, in South Bainbridge, Chenango county, New York. Immediately after my marriage, I left Mr. Stoal's, and went to my father's, and farmed with him that season."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,59,Joseph Smith--History 1:59,JS-H 1:59,"At length the time arrived for obtaining the plates, the Urim and Thummim, and the breastplate. On the twenty-second day of September, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-seven, having gone as usual at the end of another year to the place where they were deposited, the same heavenly messenger delivered them up to me with this charge: that I should be responsible for them; that if I should let them go carelessly, or through any neglect of mine, I should be cut off; but that if I would use all my endeavors to preserve them, until he, the messenger, should call for them, they should be protected."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,60,Joseph Smith--History 1:60,JS-H 1:60,"I soon found out the reason why I had received such strict charges to keep them safe, and why it was that the messenger had said that when I had done what was required at my hand, he would call for them. For no sooner was it known that I had them, than the most strenuous exertions were used to get them from me. Every stratagem that could be invented was resorted to for that purpose. The persecution became more bitter and severe than before, and multitudes were on the alert continually to get them from me if possible. But by the wisdom of God, they remained safe in my hands, until I had accomplished by them what was required at my hand. When, according to arrangements, the messenger called for them, I delivered them up to him; and he has them in his charge until this day, being the second day of May, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-eight."
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,61,Joseph Smith--History 1:61,JS-H 1:61,"The excitement, however, still continued, and rumor with her thousand tongues was all the time employed in circulating falsehoods about my father's family, and about myself. If I were to relate a thousandth part of them, it would fill up volumes. The persecution, however, became so intolerable that I was under the necessity of leaving Manchester, and going with my wife to Susquehanna county, in the State of Pennsylvania. While preparing to start--being very poor, and the persecution so heavy upon us that there was no probability that we would ever be otherwise--in the midst of our afflictions we found a friend in a gentleman by the name of Martin Harris, who came to us and gave me fifty dollars to assist us on our journey. Mr. Harris was a resident of Palmyra township, Wayne county, in the State of New York, and a farmer of respectability."

I copied a considerable number of them, and by means of the Urim and Thummim I translated some of them, which I did between the time I arrived at the house of my wife's father, in the month of December, and the February following."

For what took place relative to him and the characters, I refer to his own account of the circumstances, as he related them to me after his return, which was as follows:"
Pearl of Great Price,Pearl of Great Price,Joseph Smith--History,1,64,Joseph Smith--History 1:64,JS-H 1:64,"""I went to the city of New York, and presented the characters which had been translated, with the translation thereof, to Professor Charles Anthon, a gentleman celebrated for his literary attainments. Professor Anthon stated that the translation was correct, more so than any he had before seen translated from the Egyptian. I then showed him those which were not yet translated, and he said that they were Egyptian, Chaldaic, Assyriac, and Arabic; and he said they were true characters. He gave me a certificate, certifying to the people of Palmyra that they were true characters, and that the translation of such of them as had been translated was also correct. I took the certificate and put it into my pocket, and was just leaving the house, when Mr. Anthon called me back, and asked me how the young man found out that there were gold plates in the place where he found them. I answered that an angel of God had revealed it unto him."

I accordingly took it out of my pocket and gave it to him, when he took it and tore it to pieces, saying that there was no such thing now as ministering of angels, and that if I would bring the plates to him he would translate them. I informed him that part of the plates were sealed, and that I was forbidden to bring them. He replied, 'I cannot read a sealed book.' I left him and went to Dr. Mitchell, who sanctioned what Professor Anthon had said respecting both the characters and the translation."""

He stated to me that having been teaching school in the neighborhood where my father resided, and my father being one of those who sent to the school, he went to board for a season at his house, and while there the family related to him the circumstances of my having received the plates, and accordingly he had come to make inquiries of me."

While we were thus employed, praying and calling upon the Lord, a messenger from heaven descended in a cloud of light, and having laid his hands upon us, he ordained us, saying:"

It was on the fifteenth day of May, 1829, that we were ordained under the hand of this messenger, and baptized."

No sooner had I baptized Oliver Cowdery, than the Holy Ghost fell upon him, and he stood up and prophesied many things which should shortly come to pass. And again, so soon as I had been baptized by him, I also had the spirit of prophecy, when, standing up, I prophesied concerning the rise of this Church, and many other things connected with the Church, and this generation of the children of men. We were filled with the Holy Ghost, and rejoiced in the God of our salvation."

In the meantime we were forced to keep secret the circumstances of having received the Priesthood and our having been baptized, owing to a spirit of persecution which had already manifested itself in the neighborhood."

And their intentions of mobbing us were only counteracted by the influence of my wife's father's family (under Divine providence), who had become very friendly to me, and who were opposed to mobs, and were willing that I should be allowed to continue the work of translation without interruption; and therefore offered and promised us protection from all unlawful proceedings, as far as in them lay."
